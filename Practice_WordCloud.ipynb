       "'Paulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 1 / 94\\n\\nThe Alchemist \\n\\n- Paulo Coelho\\n\\nTranslated by Alan R. Clarke. Published 1992.\\nISBN 0-7225-3293-8.\\n\\n= CONTENTS = \\n\\nPart One \\nPart Two \\nEpilogue \\n\\n \\n\\nPART ONE \\n\\nThe boy\\'s name was Santiago. Dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his \\nherd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an \\nenormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once \\nstood. \\n\\nHe decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered \\nthrough the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the \\nflock from wandering away during the night. There were no wolves in the \\nregion, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had \\nhad to spend the entire next day searching for it. \\n\\nHe swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just \\nfinished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would have to start \\nreading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more comfortable \\npillows. \\n\\nIt was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars \\nthrough the half-destroyed roof. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 2 / 94\\n\\nI wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream \\nthat night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened before it ended.\\n\\nHe arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still \\nslept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also \\nbegan to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of \\nthe sheep, with whom he had spent the past two years, leading them \\nthrough the countryside in search of food and water. \"They are so used to \\nme that they know my schedule,\" he muttered. Thinking about that for a \\nmoment, he realized that it could be the other way around: that it was he \\nwho had become accustomed to their schedule. \\n\\nBut there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy \\nprodded them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by name. He had \\nalways believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said. So \\nthere were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an \\nimpression on him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the \\nhappiness of a shepherd in the fields. Sometimes he would comment to \\nthem on the things he had seen in the villages they passed. \\n\\nBut for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the \\ngirl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village they would reach in \\nabout four days. He had been to the village only once, the year before. The \\nmerchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop, and he always demanded \\nthat the sheep be sheared in his presence, so that he would not be \\ncheated. A friend had told the boy about the shop, and he had taken his \\nsheep there. \\n\\n* \\n\\n\"I need to sell some wool,\" the boy told the merchant. \\n\\nThe shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the \\nafternoon. So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from \\nhis bag. \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know shepherds knew how to read,\" said a girl\\'s voice behind him. \\n\\nThe girl was typical of the region of Andalusia, with flowing black hair, and \\neyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors. \\n\\n\"Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books,\" he answered. \\nDuring the two hours that they talked, she told him she was the merchant\\'s \\ndaughter, and spoke of life in the village, where each day was like all the \\nothers. The shepherd told her of the Andalusian countryside, and related the \\nnews from the other towns where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change \\nfrom talking to his sheep. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 3 / 94\\n\\n\"How did you learn to read?\" the girl asked at one point. \\n\\n\"Like everybody learns,\" he said. \"In school.\" \\n\\n\"Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?\" \\n\\nThe boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her \\nquestion. He was sure the girl would never understand. He went on telling \\nstories about his travels, and her bright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear \\nand surprise. As the time passed, the boy found himself wishing that the \\nday would never end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting \\nfor three days. He recognized that he was feeling something he had never \\nexperienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the girl with \\nthe raven hair, his days would never be the same again. \\n\\nBut finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear four sheep. \\nHe paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following \\nyear. \\n\\n* \\n\\nAnd now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village. \\nHe was excited, and at the same time uneasy: maybe the girl had already \\nforgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling their wool. \\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter,\" he said to his sheep. \"I know other girls in other places.\"\\n\\nBut in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that shepherds, like \\nseamen and like traveling salesmen, always found a town where there was \\nsomeone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering. \\n\\nThe day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of \\nthe sun. They never have to make any decisions, he thought. Maybe that\\'s \\nwhy they always stay close to me. \\n\\nThe only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as \\nthe boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia, they would be his \\nfriends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the seemingly endless hours \\nbetween sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young \\nlives, and didn\\'t understand when the boy told them about the sights of the \\ncities. They were content with just food and water, and, in exchange, they \\ngenerously gave of their wool, their company, andâ€”once in a whileâ€”their \\nmeat. \\n\\nIf I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one, they \\nwould become aware only after most of the flock had been slaughtered, \\nthought the boy. They trust me, and they\\'ve forgotten how to rely on their \\nown instincts, because I lead them to nourishment. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 4 / 94\\n\\nThe boy was surprised at his thoughts. Maybe the church, with the \\nsycamore growing from within, had been haunted. It had caused him to \\nhave the same dream for a second time, and it was causing him to feel \\nanger toward his faithful companions. He drank a bit from the wine that \\nremained from his dinner of the night before, and he gathered his jacket \\ncloser to his body. He knew that a few hours from now, with the sun at its \\nzenith, the heat would be so great that he would not be able to lead his \\nflock across the fields. It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during \\nthe summer. The heat lasted until nightfall, and all that time he had to carry \\nhis jacket. But when he thought to complain about the burden of its weight, \\nhe remembered that, because he had the jacket, he had withstood the cold \\nof the dawn. \\n\\nWe have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was grateful for the \\njacket\\'s weight and warmth. \\n\\nThe jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life was to \\ntravel, and, after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain, he knew all the \\ncities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to explain to the girl how \\nit was that a simple shepherd knew how to read. That he had attended a \\nseminary until he was sixteen. His parents had wanted him to become a \\npriest, and thereby a source of pride for a simple farm family. They worked \\nhard just to have food and water, like the sheep. He had studied Latin, \\nSpanish, and theology. But ever since he had been a child, he had wanted \\nto know the world, and this was much more important to him than knowing \\nGod and learning about man\\'s sins. One afternoon, on a visit to his family, \\nhe had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he didn\\'t want to \\nbecome a priest. That he wanted to travel. \\n\\n* \\n\\n\"People from all over the world have passed through this village, son,\" said \\nhis father. \"They come in search of new things, but when they leave they \\nare basically the same people they were when they arrived. They climb the \\nmountain to see the castle, and they wind up thinking that the past was \\nbetter than what we have now. They have blond hair, or dark skin, but \\nbasically they\\'re the same as the people who live right here.\" \\n\\n\"But I\\'d like to see the castles in the towns where they live,\" the boy \\nexplained. \\n\\n\"Those people, when they see our land, say that they would like to live here \\nforever,\" his father continued. \\n\\n\"Well, I\\'d like to see their land, and see how they live,\" said his son. \\n\\n\"The people who come here have a lot of money to spend, so they can \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 5 / 94\\n\\nafford to travel,\" his father said. \"Amongst us, the only ones who travel are \\nthe shepherds.\" \\n\\n\"Well, then I\\'ll be a shepherd!\" \\n\\nHis father said no more. The next day, he gave his son a pouch that held \\nthree ancient Spanish gold coins. \\n\\n\"I found these one day in the fields. I wanted them to be a part of your \\ninheritance. But use them to buy your flock. Take to the fields, and someday \\nyou\\'ll learn that our countryside is the best, and our women the most \\nbeautiful.\" \\n\\nAnd he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his father\\'s gaze a \\ndesire to be able, himself, to travel the worldâ€”a desire that was still alive, \\ndespite his father\\'s having had to bury it, over dozens of years, under the \\nburden of struggling for water to drink, food to eat, and the same place to \\nsleep every night of his life. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe horizon was tinged with red, and suddenly the sun appeared. The boy \\nthought back to that conversation with his father, and felt happy; he had \\nalready seen many castles and met many women (but none the equal of the \\none who awaited him several days hence). He owned a jacket, a book that \\nhe could trade for another, and a flock of sheep. But, most important, he \\nwas able every day to live out his dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian \\nfields, he could sell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he had had \\nenough of the sea, he would already have known other cities, other women, \\nand other chances to be happy. I couldn\\'t have found God in the seminary, \\nhe thought, as he looked at the sunrise. \\n\\nWhenever he could, he sought out a new road to travel. He had never been \\nto that ruined church before, in spite of having traveled through those parts \\nmany times. The world was huge and inexhaustible; he had only to allow his \\nsheep to set the route for a while, and he would discover other interesting \\nthings. The problem is that they don\\'t even realize that they\\'re walking a \\nnew road every day. They don\\'t see that the fields are new and the seasons \\nchange. All they think about is food and water. \\n\\nMaybe we\\'re all that way, the boy mused. Even meâ€”I haven\\'t thought of \\nother women since I met the merchant\\'s daughter. Looking at the sun, he \\ncalculated that he would reach Tarifa before midday. There, he could \\nexchange his book for a thicker one, fill his wine bottle, shave, and have a \\nhaircut; he had to prepare himself for his meeting with the girl, and he didn\\'t \\nwant to think about the possibility that some other shepherd, with a larger \\nflock of sheep, had arrived there before him and asked for her hand. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 6 / 94\\n\\nIt\\'s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting, \\nhe thought, as he looked again at the position of the sun, and hurried his \\npace. He had suddenly remembered that, in Tarifa, there was an old woman \\nwho interpreted dreams. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe old woman led the boy to a room at the back of her house; it was \\nseparated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads. The room\\'s \\nfurnishings consisted of a table, an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, \\nand two chairs. \\n\\nThe woman sat down, and told him to be seated as well. Then she took \\nboth of his hands in hers, and began quietly to pray. \\n\\nIt sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had experience on the \\nroad with Gypsies; they also traveled, but they had no flocks of sheep. \\nPeople said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others. It was also said \\nthat they had a pact with the devil, and that they kidnapped children and, \\ntaking them away to their mysterious camps, made them their slaves. As a \\nchild, the boy had always been frightened to death that he would be \\ncaptured by Gypsies, and this childhood fear returned when the old woman \\ntook his hands in hers. \\n\\nBut she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to reassure \\nhimself. He didn\\'t want his hand to begin trembling, showing the old woman \\nthat he was fearful. He recited an Our Father silently. \\n\\n\"Very interesting,\" said the woman, never taking her eyes from the boy\\'s \\nhands, and then she fell silent. \\n\\nThe boy was becoming nervous. His hands began to tremble, and the \\nwoman sensed it. He quickly pulled his hands away. \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t come here to have you read my palm,\" he said, already regretting \\nhaving come. He thought for a moment that it would be better to pay her \\nfee and leave without learning a thing, that he was giving too much \\nimportance to his recurrent dream. \\n\\n\"You came so that you could learn about your dreams,\" said the old woman. \\n\"And dreams are the language of God. When he speaks in our language, I \\ncan interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in the language of the soul, \\nit is only you who can understand. But, whichever it is, I\\'m going to charge \\nyou for the consultation.\" \\n\\nAnother trick, the boy thought. But he decided to take a chance. A shepherd \\nalways takes his chances with wolves and with drought, and that\\'s what \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 7 / 94\\n\\nmakes a shepherd\\'s life exciting. \\n\\n\"I have had the same dream twice,\" he said. \"I dreamed that I was in a field \\nwith my sheep, when a child appeared and began to play with the animals. I \\ndon\\'t like people to do that, because the sheep are afraid of strangers. But \\nchildren always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them. \\nI don\\'t know why. I don\\'t know how animals know the age of human \\nbeings.\" \\n\\n\"Tell me more about your dream,\" said the woman. \"I have to get back to \\nmy cooking, and, since you don\\'t have much money, I can\\'t give you a lot \\nof time.\" \\n\\n\"The child went on playing with my sheep for quite a while,\" continued the \\nboy, a bit upset. \"And suddenly, the child took me by both hands and \\ntransported me to the Egyptian pyramids.\" \\n\\nHe paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian \\npyramids were. But she said nothing. \\n\\n\"Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,\"â€”he said the last three words slowly, so \\nthat the old woman would understandâ€”\"the child said to me, If you come \\nhere, you will find a hidden treasure.\\' And, just as she was about to show \\nme the exact location, I woke up. Both times.\" \\n\\nThe woman was silent for some time. Then she again took his hands and \\nstudied them carefully. \\n\\n\"I\\'m not going to charge you anything now,\" she said. \"But I want one-tenth \\nof the treasure, if you find it.\" \\n\\nThe boy laughedâ€”out of happiness. He was going to be able to save the \\nlittle money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure! \\n\\n\"Well, interpret the dream,\" he said. \\n\\n\"First, swear to me. Swear that you will give me one-tenth of your treasure \\nin exchange for what I am going to tell you.\" \\n\\nThe shepherd swore that he would. The old woman asked him to swear \\nagain while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. \\n\\n\"It\\'s a dream in the language of the world,\" she said. \"I can interpret it, but \\nthe interpretation is very difficult. That\\'s why I feel that I deserve a part of \\nwhat you find. \\n\\n\"And this is my interpretation: you must go to the Pyramids in Egypt. I have \\nnever heard of them, but, if it was a child who showed them to you, they \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 8 / 94\\n\\nexist. There you will find a treasure that will make you a rich man.\" \\n\\nThe boy was surprised, and then irritated. He didn\\'t need to seek out the old \\nwoman for this! But then he remembered that he wasn\\'t going to have to \\npay anything. \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t need to waste my time just for this,\" he said. \\n\\n\"I told you that your dream was a difficult one. It\\'s the simple things in life \\nthat are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them. \\nAnd since I am not wise, I have had to learn other arts, such as the reading \\nof palms.\" \\n\\n\"Well, how am I going to get to Egypt?\" \\n\\n\"I only interpret dreams. I don\\'t know how to turn them into reality. That\\'s \\nwhy I have to live off what my daughters provide me with.\" \\n\\n\"And what if I never get to Egypt?\" \\n\\n\"Then I don\\'t get paid. It wouldn\\'t be the first time.\" \\n\\nAnd the woman told the boy to leave, saying she had already wasted too \\nmuch time with him. \\n\\nSo the boy was disappointed; he decided that he would never again believe \\nin dreams. He remembered that he had a number of things he had to take \\ncare of: he went to the market for something to eat, he traded his book for \\none that was thicker, and he found a bench in the plaza where he could \\nsample the new wine he had bought. The day was hot, and the wine was \\nrefreshing. The sheep were at the gates of the city, in a stable that \\nbelonged to a friend. The boy knew a lot of people in the city. That was \\nwhat made traveling appeal to himâ€”he always made new friends, and he \\ndidn\\'t need to spend all of his time with them. When someone sees the \\nsame people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary, they \\nwind up becoming a part of that person\\'s life. And then they want the \\nperson to change. If someone isn\\'t what others want them to be, the others \\nbecome angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people \\nshould lead their lives, but none about his or her own. \\n\\nHe decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before \\nfollowing his flock back through the fields. Three days from now, he would \\nbe with the merchant\\'s daughter. \\n\\nHe started to read the book he had bought. On the very first page it \\ndescribed a burial ceremony. And the names of the people involved were \\nvery difficult to pronounce. If he ever wrote a book, he thought, he would \\npresent one person at a time, so that the reader wouldn\\'t have to worry \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 9 / 94\\n\\nabout memorizing a lot of names. \\n\\nWhen he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading, he liked \\nthe book better; the burial was on a snowy day, and he welcomed the \\nfeeling of being cold. As he read on, an old man sat down at his side and \\ntried to strike up a conversation. \\n\\n\"What are they doing?\" the old man asked, pointing at the people in the \\nplaza. \\n\\n\"Working,\" the boy answered dryly, making it look as if he wanted to \\nconcentrate on his reading. \\n\\nActually, he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the \\nmerchant\\'s daughter, so that she could see that he was someone who was \\ncapable of doing difficult things. He had already imagined the scene many \\ntimes; every time, the girl became fascinated when he explained that the \\nsheep had to be sheared from back to front. He also tried to remember \\nsome good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep. Most of them he had \\nread in books, but he would tell them as if they were from his personal \\nexperience. She would never know the difference, because she didn\\'t know \\nhow to read. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation. \\nHe said that he was tired and thirsty, and asked if he might have a sip of \\nthe boy\\'s wine. The boy offered his bottle, hoping that the old man would \\nleave him alone. \\n\\nBut the old man wanted to talk, and he asked the boy what book he was \\nreading. The boy was tempted to be rude, and move to another bench, but \\nhis father had taught him to be respectful of the elderly. So he held out the \\nbook to the manâ€”for two reasons: first, that he, himself, wasn\\'t sure how to \\npronounce the title; and second, that if the old man didn\\'t know how to \\nread, he would probably feel ashamed and decide of his own accord to \\nchange benches. \\n\\n\"Hmmâ€¦\" said the old man, looking at all sides of the book, as if it were \\nsome strange object. \"This is an important book, but it\\'s really irritating.\" \\n\\nThe boy was shocked. The old man knew how to read, and had already \\nread the book. And if the book was irritating, as the old man had said, the \\nboy still had time to change it for another. \\n\\n\"It\\'s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in the world \\nsay,\" continued the old man. \"It describes people\\'s inability to choose their \\nown destinies. And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world\\'s \\ngreatest lie.\" \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 10 / 94\\n\\n\"What\\'s the world\\'s greatest lie?\" the boy asked, completely surprised. \\n\\n\"It\\'s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what\\'s \\nhappening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That\\'s the world\\'s \\ngreatest lie.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s never happened to me,\" the boy said. \"They wanted me to be a \\npriest, but I decided to become a shepherd.\" \\n\\n\"Much better,\" said the old man. \"Because you really like to travel.\" \\n\\n\"He knew what I was thinking,\" the boy said to himself. The old man, \\nmeanwhile, was leafing through the book, without seeming to want to return \\nit at all. The boy noticed that the man\\'s clothing was strange. He looked like \\nan Arab, which was not unusual in those parts. Africa was only a few hours \\nfrom Tarifa; one had only to cross the narrow straits by boat. Arabs often \\nappeared in the city, shopping and chanting their strange prayers several \\ntimes a day. \\n\\n\"Where are you from?\" the boy asked. \\n\\n\"From many places.\" \\n\\n\"No one can be from many places,\" the boy said. \"I\\'m a shepherd, and I \\nhave been to many places, but I come from only one placeâ€”from a city \\nnear an ancient castle. That\\'s where I was born.\" \\n\\n\"Well then, we could say that I was born in Salem.\" \\n\\nThe boy didn\\'t know where Salem was, but he didn\\'t want to ask, fearing \\nthat he would appear ignorant. He looked at the people in the plaza for a \\nwhile; they were coming and going, and all of them seemed to be very \\nbusy. \\n\\n\"So, what is Salem like?\" he asked, trying to get some sort of clue. \\n\\n\"It\\'s like it always has been.\" \\n\\nNo clue yet. But he knew that Salem wasn\\'t in Andalusia. If it were, he \\nwould already have heard of it. \\n\\n\"And what do you do in Salem?\" he insisted. \\n\\n\"What do I do in Salem?\" The old man laughed. \"Well, I\\'m the king of \\nSalem!\" \\n\\nPeople say strange things, the boy thought. Sometimes it\\'s better to be with \\nthe sheep, who don\\'t say anything. And better still to be alone with one\\'s \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 11 / 94\\n\\nbooks. They tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear \\nthem. But when you\\'re talking to people, they say some things that are so \\nstrange that you don\\'t know how to continue the conversation. \\n\\n\"My name is Melchizedek,\" said the old man. \"How many sheep do you \\nhave?\" \\n\\n\"Enough,\" said the boy. He could see that the old man wanted to know \\nmore about his life. \\n\\n\"Well, then, we\\'ve got a problem. I can\\'t help you if you feel you\\'ve got \\nenough sheep.\" \\n\\nThe boy was getting irritated. He wasn\\'t asking for help. It was the old man \\nwho had asked for a drink of his wine, and had started the conversation. \\n\\n\"Give me my book,\" the boy said. \"I have to go and gather my sheep and \\nget going.\" \\n\\n\"Give me one-tenth of your sheep,\" said the old man, \"and I\\'ll tell you how \\nto find the hidden treasure.\" \\n\\nThe boy remembered his dream, and suddenly everything was clear to him. \\nThe old woman hadn\\'t charged him anything, but the old manâ€”maybe he \\nwas her husbandâ€”was going to find a way to get much more money in \\nexchange for information about something that didn\\'t even exist. The old \\nman was probably a Gypsy, too. \\n\\nBut before the boy could say anything, the old man leaned over, picked up \\na stick, and began to write in the sand of the plaza. Something bright \\nreflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily \\nblinded. With a movement that was too quick for someone his age, the man \\ncovered whatever it was with his cape. When his vision returned to normal, \\nthe boy was able to read what the old man had written in the sand. \\n\\nThere, in the sand of the plaza of that small city, the boy read the names of \\nhis father and his mother and the name of the seminary he had attended. \\nHe read the name of the merchant\\'s daughter, which he hadn\\'t even known, \\nand he read things he had never told anyone. \\n\\n\"I\\'m the king of Salem,\" the old man had said. \\n\\n* \\n\\n\"Why would a king be talking with a shepherd?\" the boy asked, awed and \\nembarrassed. \\n\\n\"For several reasons. But let\\'s say that the most important is that you have \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 12 / 94\\n\\nsucceeded in discovering your destiny.\" \\n\\nThe boy didn\\'t know what a person\\'s \"destiny\" was. \\n\\n\"It\\'s what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are \\nyoung, knows what their destiny is. \\n\\n\"At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. \\nThey are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to \\nsee happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force \\nbegins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their \\ndestiny.\" \\n\\nNone of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy. But he \\nwanted to know what the \"mysterious force\" was; the merchant\\'s daughter \\nwould be impressed when he told her about that! \\n\\n\"It\\'s a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you how to \\nrealize your destiny. It prepares your spirit and your will, because there is \\none great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you \\ndo, when you really want something, it\\'s because that desire originated in \\nthe soul of the universe. It\\'s your mission on earth.\" \\n\\n\"Even when all you want to do is travel? Or marry the daughter of a textile \\nmerchant?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, or even search for treasure. The Soul of the World is nourished by \\npeople\\'s happiness. And also by unhappiness, envy, and jealousy. To \\nrealize one\\'s destiny is a person\\'s only real obligation. All things are one. \\n\\n\"And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to \\nachieve it.\" \\n\\nThey were both silent for a time, observing the plaza and the townspeople. \\nIt was the old man who spoke first. \\n\\n\"Why do you tend a flock of sheep?\" \\n\\n\"Because I like to travel.\" \\n\\nThe old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at one corner \\nof the plaza. \"When he was a child, that man wanted to travel, too. But he \\ndecided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside. When he\\'s an \\nold man, he\\'s going to spend a month in Africa. He never realized that \\npeople are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of.\" \\n\\n\"He should have decided to become a shepherd,\" the boy said. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 13 / 94\\n\\n\"Well, he thought about that,\" the old man said. \"But bakers are more \\nimportant people than shepherds. Bakers have homes, while shepherds \\nsleep out in the open. Parents would rather see their children marry bakers \\nthan shepherds.\" \\n\\nThe boy felt a pang in his heart, thinking about the merchant\\'s daughter. \\nThere was surely a baker in her town. \\n\\nThe old man continued, \"In the long run, what people think about shepherds \\nand bakers becomes more important for them than their own destinies.\" \\n\\nThe old man leafed through the book, and fell to reading a page he came \\nto. The boy waited, and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had \\nbeen interrupted. \"Why are you telling me all this?\" \\n\\n\"Because you are trying to realize your destiny. And you are at the point \\nwhere you\\'re about to give it all up.\" \\n\\n\"And that\\'s when you always appear on the scene?\" \\n\\n\"Not always in this way, but I always appear in one form or another. \\nSometimes I appear in the form of a solution, or a good idea. At other \\ntimes, at a crucial moment, I make it easier for things to happen. There are \\nother things I do, too, but most of the time people don\\'t realize I\\'ve done \\nthem.\" \\n\\nThe old man related that, the week before, he had been forced to appear \\nbefore a miner, and had taken the form of a stone. The miner had \\nabandoned everything to go mining for emeralds. For five years he had \\nbeen working a certain river, and had examined hundreds of thousands of \\nstones looking for an emerald. The miner was about to give it all up, right at \\nthe point when, if he were to examine just one more stoneâ€”just one moreâ€”\\nhe would find his emerald. Since the miner had sacrificed everything to his \\ndestiny, the old man decided to become involved. He transformed himself \\ninto a stone that rolled up to the miner\\'s foot. The miner, with all the anger \\nand frustration of his five fruitless years, picked up the stone and threw it \\naside. But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone it fell \\nupon, and there, embedded in the broken stone, was the most beautiful \\nemerald in the world. \\n\\n\"People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being,\" said the old \\nman, with a certain bitterness. \"Maybe that\\'s why they give up on it so early, \\ntoo. But that\\'s the way it is.\" \\n\\nThe boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden \\ntreasure. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 14 / 94\\n\\n\"Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water, and it is buried by the \\nsame currents,\" said the old man. \"If you want to learn about your own \\ntreasure, you will have to give me one-tenth of your flock.\" \\n\\n\"What about one-tenth of my treasure?\" \\n\\nThe old man looked disappointed. \"If you start out by promising what you \\ndon\\'t even have yet, you\\'ll lose your desire to work toward getting it.\" \\n\\nThe boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth of his \\ntreasure to the Gypsy. \\n\\n\"Gypsies are experts at getting people to do that,\" sighed the old man. \"In \\nany case, it\\'s good that you\\'ve learned that everything in life has its price. \\nThis is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach.\" \\n\\nThe old man returned the book to the boy. \\n\\n\"Tomorrow, at this same time, bring me a tenth of your flock. And I will tell \\nyou how to find the hidden treasure. Good afternoon.\" \\n\\nAnd he vanished around the corner of the plaza. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe boy began again to read his book, but he was no longer able to \\nconcentrate. He was tense and upset, because he knew that the old man \\nwas right. He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of bread, thinking \\nabout whether or not he should tell the baker what the old man had said \\nabout him. Sometimes it\\'s better to leave things as they are, he thought to \\nhimself, and decided to say nothing. If he were to say anything, the baker \\nwould spend three days thinking about giving it all up, even though he had \\ngotten used to the way things were. The boy could certainly resist causing \\nthat kind of anxiety for the baker. So he began to wander through the city, \\nand found himself at the gates. There was a small building there, with a \\nwindow at which people bought tickets to Africa. And he knew that Egypt \\nwas in Africa. \\n\\n\"Can I help you?\" asked the man behind the window. \\n\\n\"Maybe tomorrow,\" said the boy, moving away. If he sold just one of his \\nsheep, he\\'d have enough to get to the other shore of the strait. The idea \\nfrightened him. \\n\\n\"Another dreamer,\" said the ticket seller to his assistant, watching the boy \\nwalk away. \"He doesn\\'t have enough money to travel.\" \\n\\nWhile standing at the ticket window, the boy had remembered his flock, and \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 15 / 94\\n\\ndecided he should go back to being a shepherd. In two years he had \\nlearned everything about shepherding: he knew how to shear sheep, how to \\ncare for pregnant ewes, and how to protect the sheep from wolves. He \\nknew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia. And he knew what was the \\nfair price for every one of his animals. \\n\\nHe decided to return to his friend\\'s stable by the longest route possible. As \\nhe walked past the city\\'s castle, he interrupted his return, and climbed the \\nstone ramp that led to the top of the wall. From there, he could see Africa in \\nthe distance. Someone had once told him that it was from there that the \\nMoors had come, to occupy all of Spain. \\n\\nHe could see almost the entire city from where he sat, including the plaza \\nwhere he had talked with the old man. Curse the moment I met that old \\nman, he thought. He had come to the town only to find a woman who could \\ninterpret his dream. Neither the woman nor the old man were at all \\nimpressed by the fact that he was a shepherd. They were solitary individuals \\nwho no longer believed in things, and didn\\'t understand that shepherds \\nbecome attached to their sheep. He knew everything about each member of \\nhis flock: he knew which ones were lame, which one was to give birth two \\nmonths from now, and which were the laziest. He knew how to shear them, \\nand how to slaughter them. If he ever decided to leave them, they would \\nsuffer. \\n\\nThe wind began to pick up. He knew that wind: people called it the levanter, \\nbecause on it the Moors had come from the Levant at the eastern end of \\nthe Mediterranean. \\n\\nThe levanter increased in intensity. Here I am, between my flock and my \\ntreasure, the boy thought. He had to choose between something he had \\nbecome accustomed to and something he wanted to have. There was also \\nthe merchant\\'s daughter, but she wasn\\'t as important as his flock, because \\nshe didn\\'t depend on him. Maybe she didn\\'t even remember him. He was \\nsure that it made no difference to her on which day he appeared: for her, \\nevery day was the same, and when each day is the same as the next, it\\'s \\nbecause people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives \\nevery day that the sun rises. \\n\\nI left my father, my mother, and the town castle behind. They have gotten \\nused to my being away, and so have I. The sheep will get used to my not \\nbeing there, too, the boy thought. \\n\\nFrom where he sat, he could observe the plaza. People continued to come \\nand go from the baker\\'s shop. A young couple sat on the bench where he \\nhad talked with the old man, and they kissed. \\n\\n\"That bakerâ€¦\" he said to himself, without completing the thought. The \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 16 / 94\\n\\nlevanter was still getting stronger, and he felt its force on his face. That \\nwind had brought the Moors, yes, but it had also brought the smell of the \\ndesert and of veiled women. It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams \\nof men who had once left to search for the unknown, and for gold and \\nadventureâ€”and for the Pyramids. The boy felt jealous of the freedom of the \\nwind, and saw that he could have the same freedom. There was nothing to \\nhold him back except himself. The sheep, the merchant\\'s daughter, and the \\nfields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his destiny. \\n\\nThe next day, the boy met the old man at noon. He brought six sheep with \\nhim. \\n\\n\"I\\'m surprised,\" the boy said. \"My friend bought all the other sheep \\nimmediately. He said that he had always dreamed of being a shepherd, and \\nthat it was a good omen.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s the way it always is,\" said the old man. \"It\\'s called the principle of \\nfavorability. When you play cards the first time, you are almost sure to win. \\nBeginner\\'s luck.\" \\n\\n\"Why is that?\" \\n\\n\"Because there is a force that wants you to realize your destiny; it whets \\nyour appetite with a taste of success.\" \\n\\nThen the old man began to inspect the sheep, and he saw that one was \\nlame. The boy explained that it wasn\\'t important, since that sheep was the \\nmost intelligent of the flock, and produced the most wool. \\n\\n\"Where is the treasure?\" he asked. \\n\\n\"It\\'s in Egypt, near the Pyramids.\" \\n\\nThe boy was startled. The old woman had said the same thing. But she \\nhadn\\'t charged him anything. \\n\\n\"In order to find the treasure, you will have to follow the omens. God has \\nprepared a path for everyone to follow. You just have to read the omens \\nthat he left for you.\" \\n\\nBefore the boy could reply, a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him \\nand the old man. He remembered something his grandfather had once told \\nhim: that butterflies were a good omen. Like crickets, and like expectations; \\nlike lizards and four-leaf clovers. \\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" said the old man, able to read the boy\\'s thoughts. \"Just as \\nyour grandfather taught you. These are good omens.\" \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 17 / 94\\n\\nThe old man opened his cape, and the boy was struck by what he saw. The \\nold man wore a breastplate of heavy gold, covered with precious stones. \\nThe boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day. \\n\\nHe really was a king! He must be disguised to avoid encounters with \\nthieves. \\n\\n\"Take these,\" said the old man, holding out a white stone and a black stone \\nthat had been embedded at the center of the breastplate. \"They are called \\nUrim and Thummim. The black signifies \\'yes,\\' and the white \\'no.\\' When you \\nare unable to read the omens, they will help you to do so. Always ask an \\nobjective question. \\n\\n\"But, if you can, try to make your own decisions. The treasure is at the \\nPyramids; that you already knew. But I had to insist on the payment of six \\nsheep because I helped you to make your decision.\" \\n\\nThe boy put the stones in his pouch. From then on, he would make his own \\ndecisions. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing \\nelse. And don\\'t forget the language of omens. And, above all, don\\'t forget \\nto follow your destiny through to its conclusion. \\n\\n\"But before I go, I want to tell you a little story. \\n\\n\"A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness \\nfrom the wisest man in the world. The lad wandered through the desert for \\nforty days, and finally came upon a beautiful castle, high atop a mountain. It \\nwas there that the wise man lived. \\n\\n\"Rather than finding a saintly man, though, our hero, on entering the main \\nroom of the castle, saw a hive of activity: tradesmen came and went, \\npeople were conversing in the corners, a small orchestra was playing soft \\nmusic, and there was a table covered with platters of the most delicious \\nfood in that part of the world. The wise man conversed with everyone, and \\nthe boy had to wait for two hours before it was his turn to be given the \\nman\\'s attention. \\n\\n\"The wise man listened attentively to the boy\\'s explanation of why he had \\ncome, but told him that he didn\\'t have time just then to explain the secret of \\nhappiness. He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in \\ntwo hours. \\n\\n\" \\'Meanwhile, I want to ask you to do something,\\' said the wise man, \\nhanding the boy a teaspoon that held two drops of oil. \\'As you wander \\naround, carry this spoon with you without allowing the oil to spill.\\' \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 18 / 94\\n\\n\"The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of the palace, \\nkeeping his eyes fixed on the spoon. After two hours, he returned to the \\nroom where the wise man was. \\n\\n\" \\'Well,\\' asked the wise man, \\'did you see the Persian tapestries that are \\nhanging in my dining hall? Did you see the garden that it took the master \\ngardener ten years to create? Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my \\nlibrary?\\' \\n\\n\"The boy was embarrassed, and confessed that he had observed nothing. \\nHis only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise man had \\nentrusted to him. \\n\\n\" \\'Then go back and observe the marvels of my world,\\' said the wise man. \\n\\'You cannot trust a man if you don\\'t know his house.\\' \\n\\n\"Relieved, the boy picked up the spoon and returned to his exploration of \\nthe palace, this time observing all of the works of art on the ceilings and the \\nwalls. He saw the gardens, the mountains all around him, the beauty of the \\nflowers, and the taste with which everything had been selected. Upon \\nreturning to the wise man, he related in detail everything he had seen. \\n\\n\" \\'But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you?\\' asked the wise man. \\n\\n\"Looking down at the spoon he held, the boy saw that the oil was gone. \\n\\n\" \\'Well, there is only one piece of advice I can give you,\\' said the wisest of \\nwise men. \\'The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, \\nand never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.\\' \" \\n\\nThe shepherd said nothing. He had understood the story the old king had \\ntold him. A shepherd may like to travel, but he should never forget about his \\nsheep. \\n\\nThe old man looked at the boy and, with his hands held together, made \\nseveral strange gestures over the boy\\'s head. Then, taking his sheep, he \\nwalked away. \\n\\n* \\n\\nAt the highest point in Tarifa there is an old fort, built by the Moors. From \\natop its walls, one can catch a glimpse of Africa. Melchizedek, the king of \\nSalem, sat on the wall of the fort that afternoon, and felt the levanter \\nblowing in his face. The sheep fidgeted nearby, uneasy with their new \\nowner and excited by so much change. All they wanted was food and water.\\n\\nMelchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port. \\nHe would never again see the boy, just as he had never seen Abraham \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 19 / 94\\n\\nagain after having charged him his one-tenth fee. That was his work. \\n\\nThe gods should not have desires, because they don\\'t have destinies. But \\nthe king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful. \\n\\nIt\\'s too bad that he\\'s quickly going to forget my name, he thought. I should \\nhave repeated it for him. Then when he spoke about me he would say that I \\nam Melchizedek, the king of Salem. \\n\\nHe looked to the skies, feeling a bit abashed, and said, \"I know it\\'s the \\nvanity of vanities, as you said, my Lord. But an old king sometimes has to \\ntake some pride in himself.\" \\n\\nHow strange Africa is, thought the boy. \\n\\n* \\n\\nHe was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the \\nnarrow streets of Tangier. Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe \\nthat they passed from one to the other. In just a few hours he had seen men \\nwalking hand in hand, women with their faces covered, and priests that \\nclimbed to the tops of towers and chantedâ€”as everyone about him went to \\ntheir knees and placed their foreheads on the ground. \\n\\n\"A practice of infidels,\" he said to himself. As a child in church, he had \\nalways looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his white horse, \\nhis sword unsheathed, and figures such as these kneeling at his feet. The \\nboy felt ill and terribly alone. The infidels had an evil look about them. \\n\\nBesides this, in the rush of his travels he had forgotten a detail, just one \\ndetail, which could keep him from his treasure for a long time: only Arabic \\nwas spoken in this country. \\n\\nThe owner of the bar approached him, and the boy pointed to a drink that \\nhad been served at the next table. It turned out to be a bitter tea. The boy \\npreferred wine. \\n\\nBut he didn\\'t need to worry about that right now. What he had to be \\nconcerned about was his treasure, and how he was going to go about \\ngetting it. The sale of his sheep had left him with enough money in his \\npouch, and the boy knew that in money there was magic; whoever has \\nmoney is never really alone. Before long, maybe in just a few days, he \\nwould be at the Pyramids. An old man, with a breastplate of gold, wouldn\\'t \\nhave lied just to acquire six sheep. \\n\\nThe old man had spoken about signs and omens, and, as the boy was \\ncrossing the strait, he had thought about omens. Yes, the old man had \\nknown what he was talking about: during the time the boy had spent in the \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 20 / 94\\n\\nfields of Andalusia, he had become used to learning which path he should \\ntake by observing the ground and the sky. He had discovered that the \\npresence of a certain bird meant that a snake was nearby, and that a \\ncertain shrub was a sign that there was water in the area. The sheep had \\ntaught him that. \\n\\nIf God leads the sheep so well, he will also lead a man, he thought, and that \\nmade him feel better. The tea seemed less bitter. \\n\\n\"Who are you?\" he heard a voice ask him in Spanish. \\n\\nThe boy was relieved. He was thinking about omens, and someone had \\nappeared. \\n\\n\"How come you speak Spanish?\" he asked. The new arrival was a young \\nman in Western dress, but the color of his skin suggested he was from this \\ncity. He was about the same age and height as the boy. \\n\\n\"Almost everyone here speaks Spanish. We\\'re only two hours from Spain.\" \\n\\n\"Sit down, and let me treat you to something,\" said the boy. \"And ask for a \\nglass of wine for me. I hate this tea.\" \\n\\n\"There is no wine in this country,\" the young man said. \"The religion here \\nforbids it.\" \\n\\nThe boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids. He almost \\nbegan to tell about his treasure, but decided not to do so. If he did, it was \\npossible that the Arab would want a part of it as payment for taking him \\nthere. He remembered what the old man had said about offering something \\nyou didn\\'t even have yet. \\n\\n\"I\\'d like you to take me there if you can. I can pay you to serve as my \\nguide.\" \\n\\n\"Do you have any idea how to get there?\" the newcomer asked. \\n\\nThe boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby, listening attentively \\nto their conversation. He felt uneasy at the man\\'s presence. But he had \\nfound a guide, and didn\\'t want to miss out on an opportunity. \\n\\n\"You have to cross the entire Sahara desert,\" said the young man. \"And to \\ndo that, you need money. I need to know whether you have enough.\" \\n\\nThe boy thought it a strange question. But he trusted in the old man, who \\nhad said that, when you really want something, the universe always \\nconspires in your favor. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 21 / 94\\n\\nHe took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man. The \\nowner of the bar came over and looked, as well. The two men exchanged \\nsome words in Arabic, and the bar owner seemed irritated. \\n\\n\"Let\\'s get out of here\" said the new arrival. \"He wants us to leave.\" \\n\\nThe boy was relieved. He got up to pay the bill, but the owner grabbed him \\nand began to speak to him in an angry stream of words. The boy was \\nstrong, and wanted to retaliate, but he was in a foreign country. His new \\nfriend pushed the owner aside, and pulled the boy outside with him. \"He \\nwanted your money,\" he said. \"Tangier is not like the rest of Africa. This is a \\nport, and every port has its thieves.\" \\n\\nThe boy trusted his new friend. He had helped him out in a dangerous \\nsituation. He took out his money and counted it. \\n\\n\"We could get to the Pyramids by tomorrow,\" said the other, taking the \\nmoney. \"But I have to buy two camels.\" \\n\\nThey walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier. Everywhere \\nthere were stalls with items for sale. They reached the center of a large \\nplaza where the market was held. There were thousands of people there, \\narguing, selling, and buying; vegetables for sale amongst daggers, and \\ncarpets displayed alongside tobacco. But the boy never took his eye off his \\nnew friend. After all, he had all his money. He thought about asking him to \\ngive it back, but decided that would be unfriendly. He knew nothing about \\nthe customs of the strange land he was in. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll just watch him,\" he said to himself. He knew he was stronger than his \\nfriend. \\n\\nSuddenly, there in the midst of all that confusion, he saw the most beautiful \\nsword he had ever seen. The scabbard was embossed in silver, and the \\nhandle was black and encrusted with precious stones. The boy promised \\nhimself that, when he returned from Egypt, he would buy that sword. \\n\\n\"Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs,\" he said to his \\nfriend. Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments, \\nlooking at the sword. His heart squeezed, as if his chest had suddenly \\ncompressed it. He was afraid to look around, because he knew what he \\nwould find. He continued to look at the beautiful sword for a bit longer, until \\nhe summoned the courage to turn around. \\n\\nAll around him was the market, with people coming and going, shouting and \\nbuying, and the aroma of strange foodsâ€¦ but nowhere could he find his \\nnew companion. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 22 / 94\\n\\nThe boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated \\nfrom him by accident. He decided to stay right there and await his return. \\nAs he waited, a priest climbed to the top of a nearby tower and began his \\nchant; everyone in the market fell to their knees, touched their foreheads to \\nthe ground, and took up the chant. Then, like a colony of worker ants, they \\ndismantled their stalls and left. \\n\\nThe sun began its departure, as well. The boy watched it through its \\ntrajectory for some time, until it was hidden behind the white houses \\nsurrounding the plaza. He recalled that when the sun had risen that \\nmorning, he was on another continent, still a shepherd with sixty sheep, and \\nlooking forward to meeting with a girl. That morning he had known \\neverything that was going to happen to him as he walked through the \\nfamiliar fields. But now, as the sun began to set, he was in a different \\ncountry, a stranger in a strange land, where he couldn\\'t even speak the \\nlanguage. He was no longer a shepherd, and he had nothing, not even the \\nmoney to return and start everything over. \\n\\nAll this happened between sunrise and sunset, the boy thought. He was \\nfeeling sorry for himself, and lamenting the fact that his life could have \\nchanged so suddenly and so drastically. \\n\\nHe was so ashamed that he wanted to cry. He had never even wept in front \\nof his own sheep. But the marketplace was empty, and he was far from \\nhome, so he wept. He wept because God was unfair, and because this was \\nthe way God repaid those who believed in their dreams. \\n\\nWhen I had my sheep, I was happy, and I made those around me happy. \\nPeople saw me coming and welcomed me, he thought. But now I\\'m sad and \\nalone. I\\'m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one \\nperson betrayed me. I\\'m going to hate those who have found their treasure \\nbecause I never found mine. And I\\'m going to hold on to what little I have, \\nbecause I\\'m too insignificant to conquer the world. \\n\\nHe opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions; maybe there \\nwas a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship. But all he found \\nwas the heavy book, his jacket, and the two stones the old man had given \\nhim. \\n\\nAs he looked at the stones, he felt relieved for some reason. He had \\nexchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a \\ngold breastplate. He could sell the stones and buy a return ticket. But this \\ntime I\\'ll be smarter, the boy thought, removing them from the pouch so he \\ncould put them in his pocket. This was a port town, and the only truthful \\nthing his friend had told him was that port towns are full of thieves. \\n\\nNow he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset: he was \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 23 / 94\\n\\ntrying to tell him not to trust that man. \"I\\'m like everyone elseâ€”I see the \\nworld in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.\" \\n\\nHe ran his fingers slowly over the stones, sensing their temperature and \\nfeeling their surfaces. They were his treasure. Just handling them made him \\nfeel better. They reminded him of the old man. \\n\\n\"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to \\nachieve it,\" he had said. \\n\\nThe boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said. \\nThere he was in the empty marketplace, without a cent to his name, and \\nwith not a sheep to guard through the night. But the stones were proof that \\nhe had met with a kingâ€”a king who knew of the boy\\'s past. \\n\\n\"They\\'re called Urim and Thummim, and they can help you to read the \\nomens.\" The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an \\nexperiment. The old man had said to ask very clear questions, and to do \\nthat, the boy had to know what he wanted. So, he asked if the old man\\'s \\nblessing was still with him. \\n\\nHe took out one of the stones. It was \"yes.\" \\n\\n\"Am I going to find my treasure?\" he asked. \\n\\nHe stuck his hand into the pouch, and felt around for one of the stones. As \\nhe did so, both of them pushed through a hole in the pouch and fell to the \\nground. The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch. \\nHe knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch. \\nBut as he saw them lying there on the ground, another phrase came to his \\nmind. \\n\\n\"Learn to recognize omens, and follow them,\" the old king had said. \\n\\nAn omen. The boy smiled to himself. He picked up the two stones and put \\nthem back in his pouch. He didn\\'t consider mending the holeâ€”the stones \\ncould fall through any time they wanted. He had learned that there were \\ncertain things one shouldn\\'t ask about, so as not to flee from one\\'s own \\ndestiny. \"I promised that I would make my own decisions,\" he said to \\nhimself. \\n\\nBut the stones had told him that the old man was still with him, and that \\nmade him feel more confident. He looked around at the empty plaza again, \\nfeeling less desperate than before. This wasn\\'t a strange place; it was a \\nnew one. \\n\\nAfter all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new places. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 24 / 94\\n\\nEven if he never got to the Pyramids, he had already traveled farther than \\nany shepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew how different things are just \\ntwo hours by ship from where they are, he thought. Although his new world \\nat the moment was just an empty marketplace, he had already seen it when \\nit was teeming with life, and he would never forget it. He remembered the \\nsword. It hurt him a bit to think about it, but he had never seen one like it \\nbefore. As he mused about these things, he realized that he had to choose \\nbetween thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an \\nadventurer in quest of his treasure. \\n\\n\"I\\'m an adventurer, looking for treasure,\" he said to himself. \\n\\n* \\n\\nHe was shaken into wakefulness by someone. He had fallen asleep in the \\nmiddle of the marketplace, and life in the plaza was about to resume. \\n\\nLooking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he was in a \\nnew world. But instead of being saddened, he was happy. He no longer had \\nto seek out food and water for the sheep; he could go in search of his \\ntreasure, instead. He had not a cent in his pocket, but he had faith. He had \\ndecided, the night before, that he would be as much an adventurer as the \\nones he had admired in books. \\n\\nHe walked slowly through the market. The merchants were assembling their \\nstalls, and the boy helped a candy seller to do his. The candy seller had a \\nsmile on his face: he was happy, aware of what his life was about, and \\nready to begin a day\\'s work. His smile reminded the boy of the old manâ€”\\nthe mysterious old king he had met. \"This candy merchant isn\\'t making \\ncandy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeeper\\'s daughter. He\\'s \\ndoing it because it\\'s what he wants to do,\" thought the boy. He realized that \\nhe could do the same thing the old man had doneâ€”sense whether a person \\nwas near to or far from his destiny. Just by looking at them. It\\'s easy, and \\nyet I\\'ve never done it before, he thought. \\n\\nWhen the stall was assembled, the candy seller offered the boy the first \\nsweet he had made for the day. The boy thanked him, ate it, and went on \\nhis way. When he had gone only a short distance, he realized that, while \\nthey were erecting the stall, one of them had spoken Arabic and the other \\nSpanish. \\n\\nAnd they had understood each other perfectly well. \\n\\nThere must be a language that doesn\\'t depend on words, the boy thought. \\nI\\'ve already had that experience with my sheep, and now it\\'s happening with \\npeople. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 25 / 94\\n\\nHe was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things that he had \\nalready experienced, and weren\\'t really new, but that he had never \\nperceived before. And he hadn\\'t perceived them because he had become \\naccustomed to them. He realized: If I can learn to understand this language \\nwithout words, I can learn to understand the world. \\n\\nRelaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through the narrow \\nstreets of Tangier. Only in that way would he be able to read the omens. He \\nknew it would require a lot of patience, but shepherds know all about \\npatience. Once again he saw that, in that strange land, he was applying the \\nsame lessons he had learned with his sheep. \\n\\n\"All things are one,\" the old man had said. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe crystal merchant awoke with the day, and felt the same anxiety that he \\nfelt every morning. He had been in the same place for thirty years: a shop at \\nthe top of a hilly street where few customers passed. Now it was too late to \\nchange anythingâ€”the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and \\nsell crystal glassware. There had been a time when many people knew of \\nhis shop: Arab merchants, French and English geologists, German soldiers \\nwho were always well-heeled. In those days it had been wonderful to be \\nselling crystal, and he had thought how he would become rich, and have \\nbeautiful women at his side as he grew older. \\n\\nBut, as time passed, Tangier had changed. The nearby city of Ceuta had \\ngrown faster than Tangier, and business had fallen off. Neighbors moved \\naway, and there remained only a few small shops on the hill. And no one \\nwas going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops. \\n\\nBut the crystal merchant had no choice. He had lived thirty years of his life \\nbuying and selling crystal pieces, and now it was too late to do anything \\nelse. \\n\\nHe spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in \\nthe street. He had done this for years, and knew the schedule of everyone \\nwho passed. But, just before lunchtime, a boy stopped in front of the shop. \\nHe was dressed normally, but the practiced eyes of the crystal merchant \\ncould see that the boy had no money to spend. Nevertheless, the merchant \\ndecided to delay his lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on. \\n\\nA card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were \\nspoken in the shop. The boy saw a man appear behind the counter. \\n\\n* \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 26 / 94\\n\\n\"I can clean up those glasses in the window, if you want,\" said the boy. \\n\"The way they look now, nobody is going to want to buy them.\" \\n\\nThe man looked at him without responding. \\n\\n\"In exchange, you could give me something to eat.\" \\n\\nThe man still said nothing, and the boy sensed that he was going to have to \\nmake a decision. In his pouch, he had his jacketâ€”he certainly wasn\\'t going \\nto need it in the desert. Taking the jacket out, he began to clean the \\nglasses. In half an hour, he had cleaned all the glasses in the window, and, \\nas he was doing so, two customers had entered the shop and bought some \\ncrystal. \\n\\nWhen he had completed the cleaning, he asked the man for something to \\neat. \"Let\\'s go and have some lunch,\" said the crystal merchant. \\n\\nHe put a sign on the door, and they went to a small caf?nearby. As they sat \\ndown at the only table in the place, the crystal merchant laughed. \\n\\n\"You didn\\'t have to do any cleaning,\" he said. \"The Koran requires me to \\nfeed a hungry person.\" \\n\\n\"Well then, why did you let me do it?\" the boy asked. \\n\\n\"Because the crystal was dirty. And both you and I needed to cleanse our \\nminds of negative thoughts.\" \\n\\nWhen they had eaten, the merchant turned to the boy and said, \"I\\'d like you \\nto work in my shop. Two customers came in today while you were working, \\nand that\\'s a good omen.\" \\n\\nPeople talk a lot about omens, thought the shepherd. But they really don\\'t \\nknow what they\\'re saying. Just as I hadn\\'t realized that for so many years I \\nhad been speaking a language without words to my sheep. \\n\\n\"Do you want to go to work for me?\" the merchant asked. \\n\\n\"I can work for the rest of today,\" the boy answered. \"I\\'ll work all night, until \\ndawn, and I\\'ll clean every piece of crystal in your shop. In return, I need \\nmoney to get to Egypt tomorrow.\" \\n\\nThe merchant laughed. \"Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire yearâ€¦ \\neven if you earned a good commission selling every piece, you would still \\nhave to borrow money to get to Egypt. There are thousands of kilometers of \\ndesert between here and there.\" \\n\\nThere was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 27 / 94\\n\\nasleep. No sound from the bazaars, no arguments among the merchants, \\nno men climbing to the towers to chant. No hope, no adventure, no old \\nkings or destinies, no treasure, and no Pyramids. It was as if the world had \\nfallen silent because the boy\\'s soul had. He sat there, staring blankly \\nthrough the door of the caf? wishing that he had died, and that everything \\nwould end forever at that moment. \\n\\nThe merchant looked anxiously at the boy. All the joy he had seen that \\nmorning had suddenly disappeared. \\n\\n\"I can give you the money you need to get back to your country, my son,\" \\nsaid the crystal merchant. \\n\\nThe boy said nothing. He got up, adjusted his clothing, and picked up his \\npouch. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll work for you,\" he said. \\n\\nAnd after another long silence, he added, \"I need money to buy some \\nsheep.\" \\n\\nPART TWO \\n\\nThe boy had been working for the crystal merchant for almost a month, and \\nhe could see that it wasn\\'t exactly the kind of job that would make him \\nhappy. The merchant spent the entire day mumbling behind the counter, \\ntelling the boy to be careful with the pieces and not to break anything. \\n\\nBut he stayed with the job because the merchant, although he was an old \\ngrouch, treated him fairly; the boy received a good commission for each \\npiece he sold, and had already been able to put some money aside. That \\nmorning he had done some calculating: if he continued to work every day \\nas he had been, he would need a whole year to be able to buy some sheep.\\n\\n\"I\\'d like to build a display case for the crystal,\" the boy said to the \\nmerchant. \"We could place it outside, and attract those people who pass at \\nthe bottom of the hill.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ve never had one before,\" the merchant answered. \"People will pass by \\nand bump into it, and pieces will be broken.\" \\n\\n\"Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them might have \\ndied if we had come upon a snake. But that\\'s the way life is with sheep and \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 28 / 94\\n\\nwith shepherds.\" \\n\\nThe merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses. He \\nwas selling better than everâ€¦ as if time had turned back to the old days \\nwhen the street had been one of Tangier\\'s major attractions. \\n\\n\"Business has really improved,\" he said to the boy, after the customer had \\nleft. \"I\\'m doing much better, and soon you\\'ll be able to return to your sheep. \\nWhy ask more out of life?\" \\n\\n\"Because we have to respond to omens,\" the boy said, almost without \\nmeaning to; then he regretted what he had said, because the merchant had \\nnever met the king. \\n\\n\"It\\'s called the principle of favorability, beginner\\'s luck. Because life wants \\nyou to achieve your destiny,\" the old king had said. \\n\\nBut the merchant understood what the boy had said. The boy\\'s very \\npresence in the shop was an omen, and, as time passed and money was \\npouring into the cash drawer, he had no regrets about having hired the boy. \\nThe boy was being paid more money than he deserved, because the \\nmerchant, thinking that sales wouldn\\'t amount to much, had offered the boy \\na high commission rate. He had assumed he would soon return to his \\nsheep. \\n\\n\"Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?\" he asked, to get away from the \\nbusiness of the display. \\n\\n\"Because I\\'ve always heard about them,\" the boy answered, saying nothing \\nabout his dream. The treasure was now nothing but a painful memory, and \\nhe tried to avoid thinking about it. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know anyone around here who would want to cross the desert just \\nto see the Pyramids,\" said the merchant. \"They\\'re just a pile of stones. You \\ncould build one in your backyard.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'ve never had dreams of travel,\" said the boy, turning to wait on a \\ncustomer who had entered the shop. \\n\\nTwo days later, the merchant spoke to the boy about the display. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t much like change,\" he said. \"You and I aren\\'t like Hassan, that rich \\nmerchant. If he makes a buying mistake, it doesn\\'t affect him much. But we \\ntwo have to live with our mistakes.\" \\n\\nThat\\'s true enough, the boy thought, ruefully. \\n\\n\"Why did you think we should have the display?\" \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 29 / 94\\n\\n\"I want to get back to my sheep faster. We have to take advantage when \\nluck is on our side, and do as much to help it as it\\'s doing to help us. It\\'s \\ncalled the principle of favorability. Or beginner\\'s luck.\" \\n\\nThe merchant was silent for a few moments. Then he said, \"The Prophet \\ngave us the Koran, and left us just five obligations to satisfy during our \\nlives. The most important is to believe only in the one true God. The others \\nare to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan, and be charitable to the \\npoor.\" \\n\\nHe stopped there. His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the Prophet. He \\nwas a devout man, and, even with all his impatience, he wanted to live his \\nlife in accordance with Muslim law. \\n\\n\"What\\'s the fifth obligation?\" the boy asked. \\n\\n\"Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel,\" the merchant \\nanswered. \"The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a pilgrimage. We are \\nobliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy city of Mecca. \\n\\n\"Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was young, all I \\nwanted to do was put together enough money to start this shop. I thought \\nthat someday I\\'d be rich, and could go to Mecca. I began to make some \\nmoney, but I could never bring myself to leave someone in charge of the \\nshop; the crystals are delicate things. At the same time, people were \\npassing my shop all the time, heading for Mecca. Some of them were rich \\npilgrims, traveling in caravans with servants and camels, but most of the \\npeople making the pilgrimage were poorer than I. \\n\\n\"All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed the symbols \\nof the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses. One of them, a cobbler who \\nmade his living mending boots, said that he had traveled for almost a year \\nthrough the desert, but that he got more tired when he had to walk through \\nthe streets of Tangier buying his leather.\" \\n\\n\"Well, why don\\'t you go to Mecca now?\" asked the boy. \\n\\n\"Because it\\'s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That\\'s what helps \\nme face these days that are all the same, these mute crystals on the \\nshelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible caf? I\\'m afraid that if my \\ndream is realized, I\\'ll have no reason to go on living. \\n\\n\"You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids, but you\\'re different from \\nme, because you want to realize your dreams. I just want to dream about \\nMecca. I\\'ve already imagined a thousand times crossing the desert, arriving \\nat the Plaza of the Sacred Stone, the seven times I walk around it before \\nallowing myself to touch it. I\\'ve already imagined the people who would be \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 30 / 94\\n\\nat my side, and those in front of me, and the conversations and prayers we \\nwould share. But I\\'m afraid that it would all be a disappointment, so I prefer \\njust to dream about it.\" \\n\\nThat day, the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display. Not \\neveryone can see his dreams come true in the same way. \\n\\n* \\n\\nTwo more months passed, and the shelf brought many customers into the \\ncrystal shop. The boy estimated that, if he worked for six more months, he \\ncould return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet another sixty. In less \\nthan a year, he would have doubled his flock, and he would be able to do \\nbusiness with the Arabs, because he was now able to speak their strange \\nlanguage. Since that morning in the marketplace, he had never again made \\nuse of Urim and Thummim, because Egypt was now just as distant a dream \\nfor him as was Mecca for the merchant. Anyway, the boy had become \\nhappy in his work, and thought all the time about the day when he would \\ndisembark at Tarifa as a winner. \\n\\n\"You must always know what it is that you want,\" the old king had said. The \\nboy knew, and was now working toward it. Maybe it was his treasure to \\nhave wound up in that strange land, met up with a thief, and doubled the \\nsize of his flock without spending a cent. \\n\\nHe was proud of himself. He had learned some important things, like how to \\ndeal in crystal, and about the language without wordsâ€¦ and about omens. \\nOne afternoon he had seen a man at the top of the hill, complaining that it \\nwas impossible to find a decent place to get something to drink after such a \\nclimb. The boy, accustomed to recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant. \\n\\n\"Let\\'s sell tea to the people who climb the hill.\" \\n\\n\"Lots of places sell tea around here,\" the merchant said. \\n\\n\"But we could sell tea in crystal glasses. The people will enjoy the tea and \\nwant to buy the glasses. I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of \\nmen.\" \\n\\nThe merchant didn\\'t respond, but that afternoon, after saying his prayers \\nand closing the shop, he invited the boy to sit with him and share his \\nhookah, that strange pipe used by the Arabs. \\n\\n\"What is it you\\'re looking for?\" asked the old merchant. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve already told you. I need to buy my sheep back, so I have to earn the \\nmoney to do so.\" \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 31 / 94\\n\\nThe merchant put some new coals in the hookah, and inhaled deeply. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve had this shop for thirty years. I know good crystal from bad, and \\neverything else there is to know about crystal. I know its dimensions and \\nhow it behaves. If we serve tea in crystal, the shop is going to expand. And \\nthen I\\'ll have to change my way of life.\" \\n\\n\"Well, isn\\'t that good?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was thinking \\nabout how much time I had wasted in the same place, while my friends had \\nmoved on, and either went bankrupt or did better than they had before. It \\nmade me very depressed. Now, I can see that it hasn\\'t been too bad. The \\nshop is exactly the size I always wanted it to be. I don\\'t want to change \\nanything, because I don\\'t know how to deal with change. I\\'m used to the \\nway I am.\" \\n\\nThe boy didn\\'t know what to say. The old man continued, \"You have been a \\nreal blessing to me. Today, I understand something I didn\\'t see before: \\nevery blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don\\'t want anything else in life. \\nBut you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never \\nknown. Now that I have seen them, and now that I see how immense my \\npossibilities are, I\\'m going to feel worse than I did before you arrived. \\nBecause I know the things I should be able to accomplish, and I don\\'t want \\nto do so.\" \\n\\nIt\\'s good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa, thought the \\nboy to himself. \\n\\nThey went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set. They \\nwere conversing in Arabic, and the boy was proud of himself for being able \\nto do so. There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could \\nteach him everything he needed to know about the world. But they could \\nnever have taught him Arabic. \\n\\nThere are probably other things in the world that the sheep can\\'t teach me, \\nthought the boy as he regarded the old merchant. All they ever do, really, is \\nlook for food and water. And maybe it wasn\\'t that they were teaching me, \\nbut that I was learning from them. \\n\\n\"Maktub,\" the merchant said, finally. \\n\\n\"What does that mean?\" \\n\\n\"You would have to have been born an Arab to understand,\" he answered. \\n\"But in your language it would be something like \\'It is written.\\' \" \\n\\nAnd, as he smothered the coals in the hookah, he told the boy that he could \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 32 / 94\\n\\nbegin to sell tea in the crystal glasses. Sometimes, there\\'s just no way to \\nhold back the river. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe men climbed the hill, and they were tired when they reached the top. \\nBut there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea. They \\nwent in to drink the tea, which was served in beautiful crystal glasses. \\n\\n\"My wife never thought of this,\" said one, and he bought some crystalâ€”he \\nwas entertaining guests that night, and the guests would be impressed by \\nthe beauty of the glassware. The other man remarked that tea was always \\nmore delicious when it was served in crystal, because the aroma was \\nretained. The third said that it was a tradition in the Orient to use crystal \\nglasses for tea because it had magical powers. \\n\\nBefore long, the news spread, and a great many people began to climb the \\nhill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so \\nold. Other shops were opened that served tea in crystal, but they weren\\'t at \\nthe top of a hill, and they had little business. \\n\\nEventually, the merchant had to hire two more employees. He began to \\nimport enormous quantities of tea, along with his crystal, and his shop was \\nsought out by men and women with a thirst for things new. \\n\\nAnd, in that way, the months passed. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe boy awoke before dawn. It had been eleven months and nine days \\nsince he had first set foot on the African continent. \\n\\nHe dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen, bought especially for this \\nday. He put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel \\nskin. Wearing his new sandals, he descended the stairs silently. \\n\\nThe city was still sleeping. He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some \\nhot tea from a crystal glass. Then he sat in the sun-filled doorway, smoking \\nthe hookah. \\n\\nHe smoked in silence, thinking of nothing, and listening to the sound of the \\nwind that brought the scent of the desert. When he had finished his smoke, \\nhe reached into one of his pockets, and sat there for a few moments, \\nregarding what he had withdrawn. \\n\\nIt was a bundle of money. Enough to buy himself a hundred and twenty \\nsheep, a return ticket, and a license to import products from Africa into his \\nown country. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 33 / 94\\n\\nHe waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop. Then \\nthe two went off to have some more tea. \\n\\n\"I\\'m leaving today,\" said the boy. \"I have the money I need to buy my sheep.\\nAnd you have the money you need to go to Mecca.\" \\n\\nThe old man said nothing. \\n\\n\"Will you give me your blessing?\" asked the boy. \"You have helped me.\" The \\nman continued to prepare his tea, saying nothing. Then he turned to the \\nboy. \\n\\n\"I am proud of you,\" he said. \"You brought a new feeling into my crystal \\nshop. But you know that I\\'m not going to go to Mecca. Just as you know \\nthat you\\'re not going to buy your sheep.\" \\n\\n\"Who told you that?\" asked the boy, startled. \\n\\n\"Maktub\" said the old crystal merchant. \\n\\nAnd he gave the boy his blessing. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe boy went to his room and packed his belongings. They filled three \\nsacks. As he was leaving, he saw, in the corner of the room, his old \\nshepherd\\'s pouch. It was bunched up, and he had hardly thought of it for a \\nlong time. As he took his jacket out of the pouch, thinking to give it to \\nsomeone in the street, the two stones fell to the floor. Urim and Thummim. \\n\\nIt made the boy think of the old king, and it startled him to realize how long \\nit had been since he had thought of him. For nearly a year, he had been \\nworking incessantly, thinking only of putting aside enough money so that he \\ncould return to Spain with pride. \\n\\n\"Never stop dreaming,\" the old king had said. \"Follow the omens.\" \\n\\nThe boy picked up Urim and Thummim, and, once again, had the strange \\nsensation that the old king was nearby. He had worked hard for a year, and \\nthe omens were that it was time to go. \\n\\nI\\'m going to go back to doing just what I did before, the boy thought. Even \\nthough the sheep didn\\'t teach me to speak Arabic. \\n\\nBut the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there \\nwas a language in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy \\nhad used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the \\nshop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 34 / 94\\n\\nand purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired. \\nTangier was no longer a strange city, and he felt that, just as he had \\nconquered this place, he could conquer the world. \\n\\n\"When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve \\nit,\" the old king had said. \\n\\nBut the old king hadn\\'t said anything about being robbed, or about endless \\ndeserts, or about people who know what their dreams are but don\\'t want to \\nrealize them. The old king hadn\\'t told him that the Pyramids were just a pile \\nof stones, or that anyone could build one in his backyard. And he had \\nforgotten to mention that, when you have enough money to buy a flock \\nlarger than the one you had before, you should buy it. \\n\\nThe boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things. He went down \\nthe stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign couple, while two \\nother customers walked about the shop, drinking tea from crystal glasses. It \\nwas more activity than usual for this time of the morning. From where he \\nstood, he saw for the first time that the old merchant\\'s hair was very much \\nlike the hair of the old king. He remembered the smile of the candy seller, \\non his first day in Tangier, when he had nothing to eat and nowhere to goâ€”\\nthat smile had also been like the old king\\'s smile. \\n\\nIt\\'s almost as if he had been here and left his mark, he thought. And yet, \\nnone of these people has ever met the old king. On the other hand, he said \\nthat he always appeared to help those who are trying to realize their destiny.\\n\\nHe left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant. He didn\\'t want to \\ncry with the other people there. He was going to miss the place and all the \\ngood things he had learned. He was more confident in himself, though, and \\nfelt as though he could conquer the world. \\n\\n\"But I\\'m going back to the fields that I know, to take care of my flock \\nagain.\" He said that to himself with certainty, but he was no longer happy \\nwith his decision. He had worked for an entire year to make a dream come \\ntrue, and that dream, minute by minute, was becoming less important. \\nMaybe because that wasn\\'t really his dream. \\n\\nWho knowsâ€¦ maybe it\\'s better to be like the crystal merchant: never go to \\nMecca, and just go through life wanting to do so, he thought, again trying \\nto convince himself. But as he held Urim and Thummim in his hand, they \\nhad transmitted to him the strength and will of the old king. By \\ncoincidenceâ€”or maybe it was an omen, the boy thoughtâ€”he came to the \\nbar he had entered on his first day there. The thief wasn\\'t there, and the \\nowner brought him a cup of tea. \\n\\nI can always go back to being a shepherd, the boy thought. I learned how \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 35 / 94\\n\\nto care for sheep, and I haven\\'t forgotten how that\\'s done. But maybe I\\'ll \\nnever have another chance to get to the Pyramids in Egypt. The old man \\nwore a breastplate of gold, and he knew about my past. He really was a \\nking, a wise king. \\n\\nThe hills of Andalusia were only two hours away, but there was an entire \\ndesert between him and the Pyramids. Yet the boy felt that there was \\nanother way to regard his situation: he was actually two hours closer to his \\ntreasureâ€¦ the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year \\ndidn\\'t matter. \\n\\nI know why I want to get back to my flock, he thought. I understand sheep; \\nthey\\'re no longer a problem, and they can be good friends. On the other \\nhand, I don\\'t know if the desert can be a friend, and it\\'s in the desert that I \\nhave to search for my treasure. If I don\\'t find it, I can always go home. I \\nfinally have enough money, and all the time I need. Why not? \\n\\nHe suddenly felt tremendously happy. He could always go back to being a \\nshepherd. He could always become a crystal salesman again. Maybe the \\nworld had other hidden treasures, but he had a dream, and he had met with \\na king. That doesn\\'t happen to just anyone! \\n\\nHe was planning as he left the bar. He had remembered that one of the \\ncrystal merchant\\'s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans \\nthat crossed the desert. He held Urim and Thummim in his hand; because \\nof those two stones, he was once again on the way to his treasure. \\n\\n\"I am always nearby, when someone wants to realize their destiny,\" the old \\nking had told him. \\n\\nWhat could it cost to go over to the supplier\\'s warehouse and find out if the \\nPyramids were really that far away? \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe Englishman was sitting on a bench in a structure that smelled of \\nanimals, sweat, and dust; it was part warehouse, part corral. I never thought \\nI\\'d end up in a place like this, he thought, as he leafed through the pages of \\na chemical journal. Ten years at the university, and here I am in a corral. \\n\\nBut he had to move on. He believed in omens. All his life and all his studies \\nwere aimed at finding the one true language of the universe. First he had \\nstudied Esperanto, then the world\\'s religions, and now it was alchemy. He \\nknew how to speak Esperanto, he understood all the major religions well, \\nbut he wasn\\'t yet an alchemist. He had unraveled the truths behind \\nimportant questions, but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which \\nhe could not seem to go. He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 36 / 94\\n\\nan alchemist. But the alchemists were strange people, who thought only \\nabout themselves, and almost always refused to help him. Who knows, \\nmaybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master Workâ€”the \\nPhilosopher\\'s Stoneâ€”and for this reason kept their knowledge to \\nthemselves. \\n\\nHe had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his father, fruitlessly \\nseeking the Philosopher\\'s Stone. He had spent enormous amounts of time \\nat the great libraries of the world, and had purchased all the rarest and most \\nimportant volumes on alchemy. In one he had read that, many years ago, a \\nfamous Arabian alchemist had visited Europe. It was said that he was more \\nthan two hundred years old, and that he had discovered the Philosopher\\'s \\nStone and the Elixir of Life. The Englishman had been profoundly impressed \\nby the story. But he would never have thought it more than just a myth, had \\nnot a friend of hisâ€”returning from an archaeological expedition in the \\ndesertâ€”told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers. \\n\\n\"He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,\" his friend had said. \"And people say that \\nhe is two hundred years old, and is able to transform any metal into gold.\" \\n\\nThe Englishman could not contain his excitement. He canceled all his \\ncommitments and pulled together the most important of his books, and now \\nhere he was, sitting inside a dusty, smelly warehouse. Outside, a huge \\ncaravan was being prepared for a crossing of the Sahara, and was \\nscheduled to pass through Al-Fayoum. \\n\\nI\\'m going to find that damned alchemist, the Englishman thought. And the \\nodor of the animals became a bit more tolerable. \\n\\nA young Arab, also loaded down with baggage, entered, and greeted the \\nEnglishman. \\n\\n\"Where are you bound?\" asked the young Arab. \\n\\n\"I\\'m going into the desert,\" the man answered, turning back to his reading. \\nHe didn\\'t want any conversation at this point. What he needed to do was \\nreview all he had learned over the years, because the alchemist would \\ncertainly put him to the test. \\n\\nThe young Arab took out a book and began to read. The book was written in \\nSpanish. That\\'s good, thought the Englishman. He spoke Spanish better \\nthan Arabic, and, if this boy was going to Al-Fayoum, there would be \\nsomeone to talk to when there were no other important things to do. \\n\\n\"That\\'s strange,\" said the boy, as he tried once again to read the burial \\n\\n* \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 37 / 94\\n\\nscene that began the book. \"I\\'ve been trying for two years to read this book, \\nand I never get past these first few pages.\" Even without a king to provide \\nan interruption, he was unable to concentrate. \\n\\nHe still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he was able \\nto understand one thing: making a decision was only the beginning of \\nthings. When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong \\ncurrent that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first \\nmade the decision. \\n\\nWhen I decided to seek out my treasure, I never imagined that I\\'d wind up \\nworking in a crystal shop, he thought. And joining this caravan may have \\nbeen my decision, but where it goes is going to be a mystery to me. \\n\\nNearby was the Englishman, reading a book. He seemed unfriendly, and \\nhad looked irritated when the boy had entered. They might even have \\nbecome friends, but the Englishman closed off the conversation. \\n\\nThe boy closed his book. He felt that he didn\\'t want to do anything that \\nmight make him look like the Englishman. He took Urim and Thummim from \\nhis pocket, and began playing with them. \\n\\nThe stranger shouted, \"Urim and Thummim!\" \\n\\nIn a flash the boy put them back in his pocket. \\n\\n\"They\\'re not for sale,\" he said. \\n\\n\"They\\'re not worth much,\" the Englishman answered. \"They\\'re only made of \\nrock crystal, and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth. But those \\nwho know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim. \\nI didn\\'t know that they had them in this part of the world.\" \\n\\n\"They were given to me as a present by a king,\" the boy said. \\n\\nThe stranger didn\\'t answer; instead, he put his hand in his pocket, and took \\nout two stones that were the same as the boy\\'s. \\n\\n\"Did you say a king?\" he asked. \\n\\n\"I guess you don\\'t believe that a king would talk to someone like me, a \\nshepherd,\" he said, wanting to end the conversation. \\n\\n\"Not at all. It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a king that the \\nrest of the world refused to acknowledge. So, it\\'s not surprising that kings \\nwould talk to shepherds.\" \\n\\nAnd he went on, fearing that the boy wouldn\\'t understand what he was \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 38 / 94\\n\\ntalking about, \"It\\'s in the Bible. The same book that taught me about Urim \\nand Thummim. These stones were the only form of divination permitted by \\nGod. The priests carried them in a golden breastplate.\" \\n\\nThe boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse. \\n\\n\"Maybe this is an omen,\" said the Englishman, half aloud. \\n\\n\"Who told you about omens?\" The boy\\'s interest was increasing by the \\nmoment. \\n\\n\"Everything in life is an omen,\" said the Englishman, now closing the journal \\nhe was reading. \"There is a universal language, understood by everybody, \\nbut already forgotten. I am in search of that universal language, among \\nother things. That\\'s why I\\'m here. I have to find a man who knows that \\nuniversal language. An alchemist.\" \\n\\nThe conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss. \\n\\n\"You\\'re in luck, you two,\" the fat Arab said. \"There\\'s a caravan leaving today \\nfor Al-Fayoum.\" \\n\\n\"But I\\'m going to Egypt,\" the boy said. \\n\\n\"Al-Fayoum is in Egypt,\" said the Arab. \"What kind of Arab are you?\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s a good luck omen,\" the Englishman said, after the fat Arab had gone \\nout. \"If I could, I\\'d write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and \\ncoincidence. It\\'s with those words that the universal language is written.\\'\\' \\n\\nHe told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with Urim and \\nThummim in his hand. And he asked the boy if he, too, were in search of \\nthe alchemist. \\n\\n\"I\\'m looking for a treasure,\" said the boy, and he immediately regretted \\nhaving said it. But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to \\nit. \\n\\n\"In a way, so am I,\" he said. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t even know what alchemy is,\" the boy was saying, when the \\nwarehouse boss called to them to come outside. \\n\\n* \\n\\n\"I\\'m the leader of the caravan,\" said a dark-eyed, bearded man. \"I hold the \\npower of life and death for every person I take with me. The desert is a \\ncapricious lady, and sometimes she drives men crazy.\" \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 39 / 94\\n\\nThere were almost two hundred people gathered there, and four hundred \\nanimalsâ€”camels, horses, mules, and fowl. In the crowd were women, \\nchildren, and a number of men with swords at their belts and rifles slung on \\ntheir shoulders. The Englishman had several suitcases filled with books. \\nThere was a babble of noise, and the leader had to repeat himself several \\ntimes for everyone to understand what he was saying. \\n\\n\"There are a lot of different people here, and each has his own God. But the \\nonly God I serve is Allah, and in his name I swear that I will do everything \\npossible once again to win out over the desert. But I want each and every \\none of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders \\nno matter what. In the desert, disobedience means death.\" \\n\\nThere was a murmur from the crowd. Each was swearing quietly to his or \\nher own God. The boy swore to Jesus Christ. The Englishman said nothing. \\nAnd the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have. The people \\nwere also praying to heaven for protection. \\n\\nA long note was sounded on a bugle, and everyone mounted up. The boy \\nand the Englishman had bought camels, and climbed uncertainly onto their \\nbacks. The boy felt sorry for the Englishman\\'s camel, loaded down as he \\nwas with the cases of books. \\n\\n\"There\\'s no such thing as coincidence,\" said the Englishman, picking up the \\nconversation where it had been interrupted in the warehouse. \"I\\'m here \\nbecause a friend of mine heard of an Arab whoâ€¦\" \\n\\nBut the caravan began to move, and it was impossible to hear what the \\nEnglishman was saying. The boy knew what he was about to describe, \\nthough: the mysterious chain that links one thing to another, the same chain \\nthat had caused him to become a shepherd, that had caused his recurring \\ndream, that had brought him to a city near Africa, to find a king, and to be \\nrobbed in order to meet a crystal merchant, andâ€¦ \\n\\nThe closer one gets to realizing his destiny, the more that destiny becomes \\nhis true reason for being, thought the boy. \\n\\nThe caravan moved toward the east. It traveled during the morning, halted \\nwhen the sun was at its strongest, and resumed late in the afternoon. The \\nboy spoke very little with the Englishman, who spent most of his time with \\nhis books. \\n\\nThe boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across \\nthe desert. Now everything was quite different from how it was that day they \\nhad set out: then, there had been confusion and shouting, the cries of \\nchildren and the whinnying of animals, all mixed with the nervous orders of \\nthe guides and the merchants. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 40 / 94\\n\\nBut, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind, and of the \\nhoofbeats of the animals. Even the guides spoke very little to one another. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve crossed these sands many times,\" said one of the camel drivers one \\nnight. \"But the desert is so huge, and the horizons so distant, that they \\nmake a person feel small, and as if he should remain silent.\" \\n\\nThe boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever having set \\nfoot in the desert before. Whenever he saw the sea, or a fire, he fell silent, \\nimpressed by their elemental force. \\n\\nI\\'ve learned things from the sheep, and I\\'ve learned things from crystal, he \\nthought. I can learn something from the desert, too. It seems old and wise. \\n\\nThe wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he had sat at the \\nfort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face. It reminded him of the \\nwool from his sheepâ€¦ his sheep who were now seeking food and water in \\nthe fields of Andalusia, as they always had. \\n\\n\"They\\'re not my sheep anymore,\" he said to himself, without nostalgia. \\n\"They must be used to their new shepherd, and have probably already \\nforgotten me. That\\'s good. Creatures like the sheep, that are used to \\ntraveling, know about moving on.\" \\n\\nHe thought of the merchant\\'s daughter, and was sure that she had probably \\nmarried. Perhaps to a baker, or to another shepherd who could read and \\ncould tell her exciting storiesâ€”after all, he probably wasn\\'t the only one. But \\nhe was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver\\'s comment: \\nmaybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past \\nand the present of all people. \"Hunches,\" his mother used to call them. The \\nboy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion \\nof the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people \\nare connected, and we are able to know everything, because it\\'s all written \\nthere. \\n\\n\"Maktub,\" the boy said, remembering the crystal merchant. \\n\\nThe desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others. When the \\ncaravan was blocked by a boulder, it had to go around it; if there was a \\nlarge rocky area, they had to make a major detour. If the sand was too fine \\nfor the animals\\' hooves, they sought a way where the sand was more \\nsubstantial. In some places, the ground was covered with the salt of dried-\\nup lakes. The animals balked at such places, and the camel drivers were \\nforced to dismount and unburden their charges. The drivers carried the \\nfreight themselves over such treacherous footing, and then reloaded the \\ncamels. If a guide were to fall ill or die, the camel drivers would draw lots \\nand appoint a new one. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 41 / 94\\n\\nBut all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many detours \\nand adjustments it made, the caravan moved toward the same compass \\npoint. Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to its course, sighting on \\na star that indicated the location of the oasis. When the people saw that \\nstar shining in the morning sky, they knew they were on the right course \\ntoward water, palm trees, shelter, and other people. It was only the \\nEnglishman who was unaware of all this; he was, for the most part, \\nimmersed in reading his books. \\n\\nThe boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the first few \\ndays of the journey. But he found it much more interesting to observe the \\ncaravan and listen to the wind. As soon as he had learned to know his \\ncamel better, and to establish a relationship with him, he threw the book \\naway. Although the boy had developed a superstition that each time he \\nopened the book he would learn something important, he decided it was an \\nunnecessary burden. \\n\\nHe became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him. At \\nnight, as they sat around the fire, the boy related to the driver his \\nadventures as a shepherd. \\n\\nDuring one of these conversations, the driver told of his own life. \\n\\n\"I used to live near El Cairum,\" he said. \"I had my orchard, my children, and \\na life that would change not at all until I died. One year, when the crop was \\nthe best ever, we all went to Mecca, and I satisfied the only unmet \\nobligation in my life. I could die happily, and that made me feel good. \\n\\n\"One day, the earth began to tremble, and the Nile overflowed its banks. It \\nwas something that I thought could happen only to others, never to me. My \\nneighbors feared they would lose all their olive trees in the flood, and my \\nwife was afraid that we would lose our children. I thought that everything I \\nowned would be destroyed. \\n\\n\"The land was ruined, and I had to find some other way to earn a living. So \\nnow I\\'m a camel driver. But that disaster taught me to understand the word \\nof Allah: people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving \\nwhat they need and want. \\n\\n\"We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it\\'s our life or our \\npossessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we understand \\nthat our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same \\nhand.\" \\n\\nSometimes, their caravan met with another. One always had something that \\nthe other neededâ€”as if everything were indeed written by one hand. As they \\nsat around the fire, the camel drivers exchanged information about \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 42 / 94\\n\\nwindstorms, and told stories about the desert. \\n\\nAt other times, mysterious, hooded men would appear; they were Bedouins \\nwho did surveillance along the caravan route. They provided warnings about \\nthieves and barbarian tribes. They came in silence and departed the same \\nway, dressed in black garments that showed only their eyes. One night, a \\ncamel driver came to the fire where the Englishman and the boy were \\nsitting. \"There are rumors of tribal wars,\" he told them. \\n\\nThe three fell silent. The boy noted that there was a sense of fear in the air, \\neven though no one said anything. Once again he was experiencing the \\nlanguage without wordsâ€¦ the universal language. \\n\\nThe Englishman asked if they were in danger. \\n\\n\"Once you get into the desert, there\\'s no going back,\" said the camel driver. \\n\"And, when you can\\'t go back, you have to worry only about the best way of \\nmoving forward. The rest is up to Allah, including the danger.\" \\n\\nAnd he concluded by saying the mysterious word: \"Maktub.\" \\n\\n\"You should pay more attention to the caravan,\" the boy said to the \\nEnglishman, after the camel driver had left. \"We make a lot of detours, but \\nwe\\'re always heading for the same destination.\" \\n\\n\"And you ought to read more about the world,\" answered the Englishman. \\n\"Books are like caravans in that respect.\" \\n\\nThe immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster. The \\ndays had always been silent, but now, even the nightsâ€”when the travelers \\nwere accustomed to talking around the firesâ€”had also become quiet. And, \\none day, the leader of the caravan made the decision that the fires should \\nno longer be lighted, so as not to attract attention to the caravan. \\n\\nThe travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a circle at \\nnight, sleeping together in the center as protection against the nocturnal \\ncold. And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group. \\n\\nThe Englishman was unable to sleep one night. He called to the boy, and \\nthey took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment. There was a \\nfull moon, and the boy told the Englishman the story of his life. \\n\\nThe Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at \\nthe crystal shop after the boy began working there. \\n\\n\"That\\'s the principle that governs all things,\" he said. \"In alchemy, it\\'s called \\nthe Soul of the World. When you want something with all your heart, that\\'s \\nwhen you are closest to the Soul of the World. It\\'s always a positive force.\" \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 43 / 94\\n\\nHe also said that this was not just a human gift, that everything on the face \\nof the earth had a soul, whether mineral, vegetable, or animalâ€”or even just \\na simple thought. \\n\\n\"Everything on earth is being continuously transformed, because the earth is \\naliveâ€¦ and it has a soul. We are part of that soul, so we rarely recognize \\nthat it is working for us. But in the crystal shop you probably realized that \\neven the glasses were collaborating in your success.\" \\n\\nThe boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the \\nbleached sands. \"I have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert,\" he \\nsaid. \"The caravan and the desert speak the same language, and it\\'s for \\nthat reason that the desert allows the crossing. It\\'s going to test the \\ncaravan\\'s every step to see if it\\'s in time, and, if it is, we will make it to the \\noasis.\" \\n\\n\"If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal courage, but \\nwithout understanding that language, this journey would have been much \\nmore difficult.\" \\n\\nThey stood there looking at the moon. \\n\\n\"That\\'s the magic of omens,\" said the boy. \"I\\'ve seen how the guides read \\nthe signs of the desert, and how the soul of the caravan speaks to the soul \\nof the desert.\" \\n\\nThe Englishman said, \"I\\'d better pay more attention to the caravan.\" \\n\\n\"And I\\'d better read your books,\" said the boy. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThey were strange books. They spoke about mercury, salt, dragons, and \\nkings, and he didn\\'t understand any of it. But there was one idea that \\nseemed to repeat itself throughout all the books: all things are the \\nmanifestation of one thing only. \\n\\nIn one of the books he learned that the most important text in the literature \\nof alchemy contained only a few lines, and had been inscribed on the \\nsurface of an emerald. \\n\\n\"It\\'s the Emerald Tablet,\" said the Englishman, proud that he might teach \\nsomething to the boy. \\n\\n\"Well, then, why do we need all these books?\" the boy asked. \\n\\n\"So that we can understand those few lines,\" the Englishman answered, \\nwithout appearing really to believe what he had said. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 44 / 94\\n\\nThe book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous \\nalchemists. They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the \\npurification of metals in their laboratories; they believed that, if a metal were \\nheated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and \\nwhat was left would be the Soul of the World. This Soul of the World allowed \\nthem to understand anything on the face of the earth, because it was the \\nlanguage with which all things communicated. They called that discovery \\nthe Master Workâ€”it was part liquid and part solid. \\n\\n\"Can\\'t you just observe men and omens in order to understand the \\nlanguage?\" the boy asked. \\n\\n\"You have a mania for simplifying everything,\" answered the Englishman, \\nirritated. \"Alchemy is a serious discipline. Every step has to be followed \\nexactly as it was followed by the masters.\" \\n\\nThe boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was called the Elixir \\nof Life, and that it cured all illnesses; it also kept the alchemist from \\ngrowing old. And the solid part was called the Philosopher\\'s Stone. \\n\\n\"It\\'s not easy to find the Philosopher\\'s Stone,\" said the Englishman. \"The \\nalchemists spent years in their laboratories, observing the fire that purified \\nthe metals. They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they \\ngave up the vanities of the world. They discovered that the purification of \\nthe metals had led to a purification of themselves.\" \\n\\nThe boy thought about the crystal merchant. He had said that it was a good \\nthing for the boy to clean the crystal pieces, so that he could free himself \\nfrom negative thoughts. The boy was becoming more and more convinced \\nthat alchemy could be learned in one\\'s daily life. \\n\\n\"Also,\" said the Englishman, \"the Philosopher\\'s Stone has a fascinating \\nproperty. A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal \\ninto gold.\" \\n\\nHaving heard that, the boy became even more interested in alchemy. He \\nthought that, with some patience, he\\'d be able to transform everything into \\ngold. He read the lives of the various people who had succeeded in doing \\nso: Helv?ius, Elias, Fulcanelli, and Geber. They were fascinating stories: \\neach of them lived out his destiny to the end. They traveled, spoke with \\nwise men, performed miracles for the incredulous, and owned the \\nPhilosopher\\'s Stone and the Elixir of Life. \\n\\nBut when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master Work, he \\nbecame completely lost. There were just drawings, coded instructions, and \\nobscure texts. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 45 / 94\\n\\n* \\n\\n\"Why do they make things so complicated?\" he asked the Englishman one \\nnight. The boy had noticed that the Englishman was irritable, and missed his \\nbooks. \\n\\n\"So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can \\nunderstand,\" he said. \"Imagine if everyone went around transforming lead \\ninto gold. Gold would lose its value. \\n\\n\"It\\'s only those who are persistent, and willing to study things deeply, who \\nachieve the Master Work. That\\'s why I\\'m here in the middle of the desert. \\nI\\'m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes.\" \\n\\n\"When were these books written?\" the boy asked. \\n\\n\"Many centuries ago.\" \\n\\n\"They didn\\'t have the printing press in those days,\" the boy argued. \"There \\nwas no way for everybody to know about alchemy. Why did they use such \\nstrange language, with so many drawings?\" \\n\\nThe Englishman didn\\'t answer him directly. He said that for the past few \\ndays he had been paying attention to how the caravan operated, but that he \\nhadn\\'t learned anything new. The only thing he had noticed was that talk of \\nwar was becoming more and more frequent. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThen one day the boy returned the books to the Englishman. \"Did you learn \\nanything?\" the Englishman asked, eager to hear what it might be. He \\nneeded someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of \\nwar. \\n\\n\"I learned that the world has a soul, and that whoever understands that soul \\ncan also understand the language of things. I learned that many alchemists \\nrealized their destinies, and wound up discovering the Soul of the World, the \\nPhilosopher\\'s Stone, and the Elixir of Life. \\n\\n\"But, above all, I learned that these things are all so simple that they could \\nbe written on the surface of an emerald.\" \\n\\nThe Englishman was disappointed. The years of research, the magic \\nsymbols, the strange words and the laboratory equipmentâ€¦ none of this \\nhad made an impression on the boy. His soul must be too primitive to \\nunderstand those things, he thought. \\n\\nHe took back his books and packed them away again in their bags. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 46 / 94\\n\\n\"Go back to watching the caravan,\" he said. \"That didn\\'t teach me anything, \\neither.\" \\n\\nThe boy went back to contemplating the silence of the desert, and the sand \\nraised by the animals. \"Everyone has his or her own way of learning things,\" \\nhe said to himself. \"His way isn\\'t the same as mine, nor mine as his. But \\nwe\\'re both in search of our destinies, and I respect him for that.\" \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe caravan began to travel day and night. The hooded Bedouins \\nreappeared more and more frequently, and the camel driverâ€”who had \\nbecome a good friend of the boy\\'sâ€”explained that the war between the \\ntribes had already begun. The caravan would be very lucky to reach the \\noasis. \\n\\nThe animals were exhausted, and the men talked among themselves less \\nand less. The silence was the worst aspect of the night, when the mere \\ngroan of a camelâ€”which before had been nothing but the groan of a \\ncamelâ€”now frightened everyone, because it might signal a raid. \\n\\nThe camel driver, though, seemed not to be very concerned with the threat \\nof war. \\n\\n\"I\\'m alive,\" he said to the boy, as they ate a bunch of dates one night, with \\nno fires and no moon. \"When I\\'m eating, that\\'s all I think about. If I\\'m on the \\nmarch, I just concentrate on marching. If I have to fight, it will be just as \\ngood a day to die as any other. \\n\\n\"Because I don\\'t live in either my past or my future. I\\'m interested only in \\nthe present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you\\'ll be a happy \\nman. You\\'ll see that there is life in the desert, that there are stars in the \\nheavens, and that tribesmen fight because they are part of the human race. \\nLife will be a party for you, a grand festival, because life is the moment \\nwe\\'re living right now.\" \\n\\nTwo nights later, as he was getting ready to bed down, the boy looked for \\nthe star they followed every night. He thought that the horizon was a bit \\nlower than it had been, because he seemed to see stars on the desert itself.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the oasis,\" said the camel driver. \\n\\n\"Well, why don\\'t we go there right now?\" the boy asked. \\n\\n\"Because we have to sleep.\" \\n\\n* \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 47 / 94\\n\\nThe boy awoke as the sun rose. There, in front of him, where the small stars \\nhad been the night before, was an endless row of date palms, stretching \\nacross the entire desert. \\n\\n\"We\\'ve done it!\" said the Englishman, who had also awakened early. \\n\\nBut the boy was quiet. He was at home with the silence of the desert, and \\nhe was content just to look at the trees. He still had a long way to go to \\nreach the pyramids, and someday this morning would just be a memory. But \\nthis was the present momentâ€”the party the camel driver had mentionedâ€”\\nand he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of \\nthe future. Although the vision of the date palms would someday be just a \\nmemory, right now it signified shade, water, and a refuge from the war. \\nYesterday, the camel\\'s groan signaled danger, and now a row of date palms \\ncould herald a miracle. \\n\\nThe world speaks many languages, the boy thought. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe times rush past, and so do the caravans, thought the alchemist, as he \\nwatched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the oasis. People \\nwere shouting at the new arrivals, dust obscured the desert sun, and the \\nchildren of the oasis were bursting with excitement at the arrival of the \\nstrangers. The alchemist saw the tribal chiefs greet the leader of the \\ncaravan, and converse with him at length. \\n\\nBut none of that mattered to the alchemist. He had already seen many \\npeople come and go, and the desert remained as it was. He had seen kings \\nand beggars walking the desert sands. The dunes were changed constantly \\nby the wind, yet these were the same sands he had known since he was a \\nchild. He always enjoyed seeing the happiness that the travelers \\nexperienced when, after weeks of yellow sand and blue sky, they first saw \\nthe green of the date palms. Maybe God created the desert so that man \\ncould appreciate the date trees, he thought. \\n\\nHe decided to concentrate on more practical matters. He knew that in the \\ncaravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets. The \\nomens had told him so. He didn\\'t know the man yet, but his practiced eye \\nwould recognize him when he appeared. He hoped that it would be \\nsomeone as capable as his previous apprentice. \\n\\nI don\\'t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth, he \\nthought. It wasn\\'t exactly that they were secrets; God revealed his secrets \\neasily to all his creatures. \\n\\nHe had only one explanation for this fact: things have to be transmitted this \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 48 / 94\\n\\nway because they were made up from the pure life, and this kind of life \\ncannot be captured in pictures or words. \\n\\nBecause people become fascinated with pictures and words, and wind up \\nforgetting the Language of the World. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe boy couldn\\'t believe what he was seeing: the oasis, rather than being \\njust a well surrounded by a few palm treesâ€”as he had seen once in a \\ngeography bookâ€”was much larger than many towns back in Spain. There \\nwere three hundred wells, fifty thousand date trees, and innumerable \\ncolored tents spread among them. \\n\\n\"It looks like The Thousand and One Nights,\" said the Englishman, impatient \\nto meet with the alchemist. \\n\\nThey were surrounded by children, curious to look at the animals and \\npeople that were arriving. The men of the oasis wanted to know if they had \\nseen any fighting, and the women competed with one another for access to \\nthe cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants. The silence of the \\ndesert was a distant dream; the travelers in the caravan were talking \\nincessantly, laughing and shouting, as if they had emerged from the \\nspiritual world and found themselves once again in the world of people. \\nThey were relieved and happy. \\n\\nThey had been taking careful precautions in the desert, but the camel driver \\nexplained to the boy that oases were always considered to be neutral \\nterritories, because the majority of the inhabitants were women and \\nchildren. There were oases throughout the desert, but the tribesmen fought \\nin the desert, leaving the oases as places of refuge. \\n\\nWith some difficulty, the leader of the caravan brought all his people \\ntogether and gave them his instructions. The group was to remain there at \\nthe oasis until the conflict between the tribes was over. Since they were \\nvisitors, they would have to share living space with those who lived there, \\nand would be given the best accommodations. That was the law of \\nhospitality. Then he asked that everyone, including his own sentinels, hand \\nover their arms to the men appointed by the tribal chieftains. \\n\\n\"Those are the rules of war,\" the leader explained. \"The oases may not \\nshelter armies or troops.\" \\n\\nTo the boy\\'s surprise, the Englishman took a chrome-plated revolver out of \\nhis bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms. \\n\\n\"Why a revolver?\" he asked. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 49 / 94\\n\\n\"It helped me to trust in people,\" the Englishman answered. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the boy thought about his treasure. The closer he got to the \\nrealization of his dream, the more difficult things became. It seemed as if \\nwhat the old king had called \"beginner\\'s luck\" were no longer functioning. In \\nhis pursuit of the dream, he was being constantly subjected to tests of his \\npersistence and courage. So he could not be hasty, nor impatient. If he \\npushed forward impulsively, he would fail to see the signs and omens left \\nby God along his path. \\n\\nGod placed them along my path. He had surprised himself with the thought. \\nUntil then, he had considered the omens to be things of this world. Like \\neating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a job. He had never \\nthought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he \\nshould do. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t be impatient,\" he repeated to himself. \"It\\'s like the camel driver said: \\n\\'Eat when it\\'s time to eat. And move along when it\\'s time to move along.\\' \" \\n\\nThat first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the Englishman. \\nThe boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a tent with five other \\nyoung men of about his age. They were people of the desert, and clamored \\nto hear his stories about the great cities. \\n\\nThe boy told them about his life as a shepherd, and was about to tell them \\nof his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the \\ntent. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve been looking for you all morning,\" he said, as he led the boy outside. \"I \\nneed you to help me find out where the alchemist lives.\" \\n\\nFirst, they tried to find him on their own. An alchemist would probably live in \\na manner that was different from that of the rest of the people at the oasis, \\nand it was likely that in his tent an oven was continuously burning. They \\nsearched everywhere, and found that the oasis was much larger than they \\ncould have imagined; there were hundreds of tents. \\n\\n\"We\\'ve wasted almost the entire day,\" said the Englishman, sitting down \\nwith the boy near one of the wells. \\n\\n\"Maybe we\\'d better ask someone,\" the boy suggested. \\n\\nThe Englishman didn\\'t want to tell others about his reasons for being at the \\noasis, and couldn\\'t make up his mind. But, finally, he agreed that the boy, \\nwho spoke better Arabic than he, should do so. The boy approached a \\nwoman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water. \\n\\n\"Good afternoon, ma\\'am. I\\'m trying to find out where the alchemist lives \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 50 / 94\\n\\nhere at the oasis.\" \\n\\nThe woman said she had never heard of such a person, and hurried away. \\nBut before she fled, she advised the boy that he had better not try to \\nconverse with women who were dressed in black, because they were \\nmarried women. He should respect tradition. \\n\\nThe Englishman was disappointed. It seemed he had made the long journey \\nfor nothing. The boy was also saddened; his friend was in pursuit of his \\ndestiny. And, when someone was in such pursuit, the entire universe made \\nan effort to help him succeedâ€”that\\'s what the old king had said. He \\ncouldn\\'t have been wrong. \\n\\n\"I had never heard of alchemists before,\" the boy said. \"Maybe no one here \\nhas, either.\" \\n\\nThe Englishman\\'s eyes lit up. \"That\\'s it! Maybe no one here knows what an \\nalchemist is! Find out who it is who cures the people\\'s illnesses!\" \\n\\nSeveral women dressed in black came to the well for water, but the boy \\nwould speak to none of them, despite the Englishman\\'s insistence. Then a \\nman approached. \\n\\n\"Do you know someone here who cures people\\'s illnesses?\" the boy asked. \\n\\n\"Allah cures our illnesses,\" said the man, clearly frightened of the strangers. \\n\"You\\'re looking for witch doctors.\" He spoke some verses from the Koran, \\nand moved on. \\n\\nAnother man appeared. He was older, and was carrying a small bucket. The \\nboy repeated his question. \\n\\n\"Why do you want to find that sort of person?\" the Arab asked. \\n\\n\"Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order to meet with \\nhim,\" the boy said. \\n\\n\"If such a man is here at the oasis, he must be the very powerful one,\" said \\nthe old man after thinking for a few moments. \"Not even the tribal chieftains \\nare able to see him when they want to. Only when he consents. \\n\\n\"Wait for the end of the war. Then leave with the caravan. Don\\'t try to enter \\ninto the life of the oasis,\" he said, and walked away. \\n\\nBut the Englishman was exultant. They were on the right track. \\n\\nFinally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black. She had \\na vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered by a veil, but her face \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 51 / 94\\n\\nwas uncovered. The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist. \\n\\nAt that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the \\nWorld surged within him. When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that \\nher lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he learned the most \\nimportant part of the language that all the world spokeâ€”the language that \\neveryone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. \\nSomething older than humanity, more ancient than the desert. Something \\nthat exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs \\nhere at the well. She smiled, and that was certainly an omenâ€”the omen he \\nhad been awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life. The omen \\nhe had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the crystals and in \\nthe silence of the desert. \\n\\nIt was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation, just as \\nthe universe needs none as it travels through endless time. What the boy \\nfelt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in \\nhis life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. \\nHe was more certain of it than of anything in the world. He had been told by \\nhis parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a \\nperson before becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way \\nhad never learned the universal language. Because, when you know that \\nlanguage, it\\'s easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, \\nwhether it\\'s in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when two \\nsuch people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the \\nfuture become unimportant. There is only that moment, and the incredible \\ncertainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. It \\nis the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the \\nworld. Without such love, one\\'s dreams would have no meaning. \\n\\nMaktub, thought the boy. \\n\\nThe Englishman shook the boy: \"Come on, ask her!\" \\n\\nThe boy stepped closer to the girl, and when she smiled, he did the same. \\n\\n\"What\\'s your name?\" he asked. \\n\\n\"Fatima,\" the girl said, averting her eyes. \\n\\n\"That\\'s what some women in my country are called.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s the name of the Prophet\\'s daughter,\" Fatima said. \"The invaders carried \\nthe name everywhere.\" The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride. \\n\\nThe Englishman prodded him, and the boy asked her about the man who \\ncured people\\'s illnesses. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 52 / 94\\n\\n\"That\\'s the man who knows all the secrets of the world,\" she said. \"He \\ncommunicates with the genies of the desert.\" \\n\\nThe genies were the spirits of good and evil. And the girl pointed to the \\nsouth, indicating that it was there the strange man lived. Then she filled her \\nvessel with water and left. \\n\\nThe Englishman vanished, too, gone to find the alchemist. And the boy sat \\nthere by the well for a long time, remembering that one day in Tarifa the \\nlevanter had brought to him the perfume of that woman, and realizing that \\nhe had loved her before he even knew she existed. He knew that his love for \\nher would enable him to discover every treasure in the world. \\n\\nThe next day, the boy returned to the well, hoping to see the girl. To his \\nsurprise, the Englishman was there, looking out at the desert, \\n\\n\"I waited all afternoon and evening,\" he said. \"He appeared with the first \\nstars of evening. I told him what I was seeking, and he asked me if I had \\never transformed lead into gold. I told him that was what I had come here to \\nlearn. \\n\\n\"He told me I should try to do so. That\\'s all he said: \\'Go and try.\\' \" \\n\\nThe boy didn\\'t say anything. The poor Englishman had traveled all this way, \\nonly to be told that he should repeat what he had already done so many \\ntimes. \\n\\n\"So, then try,\" he said to the Englishman. \\n\\n\"That\\'s what I\\'m going to do. I\\'m going to start now.\" \\n\\nAs the Englishman left, Fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water. \\n\\n\"I came to tell you just one thing,\" the boy said. \"I want you to be my wife. I \\nlove you.\" \\n\\nThe girl dropped the container, and the water spilled. \\n\\n\"I\\'m going to wait here for you every day. I have crossed the desert in \\nsearch of a treasure that is somewhere near the Pyramids, and for me, the \\nwar seemed a curse. But now it\\'s a blessing, because it brought me to \\nyou.\" \\n\\n\"The war is going to end someday,\" the girl said. \\n\\nThe boy looked around him at the date palms. He reminded himself that he \\nhad been a shepherd, and that he could be a shepherd again. Fatima was \\nmore important than his treasure. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 53 / 94\\n\\n\"The tribesmen are always in search of treasure,\" the girl said, as if she had \\nguessed what he was thinking. \"And the women of the desert are proud of \\ntheir tribesmen.\" \\n\\nShe refilled her vessel and left. \\n\\nThe boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima. He told her about \\nhis life as a shepherd, about the king, and about the crystal shop. They \\nbecame friends, and except for the fifteen minutes he spent with her, each \\nday seemed that it would never pass. When he had been at the oasis for \\nalmost a month, the leader of the caravan called a meeting of all of the \\npeople traveling with him. \\n\\n\"We don\\'t know when the war will end, so we can\\'t continue our journey,\" \\nhe said. \"The battles may last for a long time, perhaps even years. There are \\npowerful forces on both sides, and the war is important to both armies. It\\'s \\nnot a battle of good against evil. It\\'s a war between forces that are fighting \\nfor the balance of power, and, when that type of battle begins, it lasts \\nlonger than othersâ€”because Allah is on both sides.\" \\n\\nThe people went back to where they were living, and the boy went to meet \\nwith Fatima that afternoon. He told her about the morning\\'s meeting. \"The \\nday after we met,\" Fatima said, \"you told me that you loved me. Then, you \\ntaught me something of the universal language and the Soul of the World. \\nBecause of that, I have become a part of you.\" \\n\\nThe boy listened to the sound of her voice, and thought it to be more \\nbeautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms. \\n\\n\"I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time. I have \\nforgotten about my past, about my traditions, and the way in which men of \\nthe desert expect women to behave. Ever since I was a child, I have \\ndreamed that the desert would bring me a wonderful present. Now, my \\npresent has arrived, and it\\'s you.\" \\n\\nThe boy wanted to take her hand. But Fatima\\'s hands held to the handles of \\nher jug. \\n\\n\"You have told me about your dreams, about the old king and your treasure. \\nAnd you\\'ve told me about omens. So now, I fear nothing, because it was \\nthose omens that brought you to me. And I am a part of your dream, a part \\nof your destiny, as you call it. \\n\\n\"That\\'s why I want you to continue toward your goal. If you have to wait until \\nthe war is over, then wait. But if you have to go before then, go on in \\npursuit of your dream. The dunes are changed by the wind, but the desert \\nnever changes. That\\'s the way it will be with our love for each other. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 54 / 94\\n\\n\"Maktub,\" she said. \"If I am really a part of your dream, you\\'ll come back \\none day.\" \\n\\nThe boy was sad as he left her that day. He thought of all the married \\nshepherds he had known. They had a difficult time convincing their wives \\nthat they had to go off into distant fields. Love required them to stay with \\nthe people they loved. \\n\\nHe told Fatima that, at their next meeting. \\n\\n\"The desert takes our men from us, and they don\\'t always return,\" she said. \\n\"We know that, and we are used to it. Those who don\\'t return become a \\npart of the clouds, a part of the animals that hide in the ravines and of the \\nwater that comes from the earth. They become a part of everythingâ€¦ they \\nbecome the Soul of the World. \\n\\n\"Some do come back. And then the other women are happy because they \\nbelieve that their men may one day return, as well. I used to look at those \\nwomen and envy them their happiness. Now, I too will be one of the women \\nwho wait. \\n\\n\"I\\'m a desert woman, and I\\'m proud of that. I want my husband to wander \\nas free as the wind that shapes the dunes. And, if I have to, I will accept the \\nfact that he has become a part of the clouds, and the animals and the water \\nof the desert.\" \\n\\nThe boy went to look for the Englishman. He wanted to tell him about \\nFatima. He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman had built \\nhimself a furnace outside his tent. It was a strange furnace, fueled by \\nfirewood, with a transparent flask heating on top. As the Englishman stared \\nout at the desert, his eyes seemed brighter than they had when he was \\nreading his books. \\n\\n\"This is the first phase of the job,\" he said. \"I have to separate out the \\nsulfur. To do that successfully, I must have no fear of failure. It was my fear \\nof failure that first kept me from attempting the Master Work. Now, I\\'m \\nbeginning what I could have started ten years ago. But I\\'m happy at least \\nthat I didn\\'t wait twenty years.\" \\n\\nHe continued to feed the fire, and the boy stayed on until the desert turned \\npink in the setting sun. He felt the urge to go out into the desert, to see if \\nits silence held the answers to his questions. \\n\\nHe wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight. \\nHe listened to the wind, and felt the stones beneath his feet. Here and \\nthere, he found a shell, and realized that the desert, in remote times, had \\nbeen a sea. He sat on a stone, and allowed himself to become hypnotized \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 55 / 94\\n\\nby the horizon. He tried to deal with the concept of love as distinct from \\npossession, and couldn\\'t separate them. But Fatima was a woman of the \\ndesert, and, if anything could help him to understand, it was the desert. \\n\\nAs he sat there thinking, he sensed movement above him. Looking up, he \\nsaw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky. \\n\\nHe watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind. Although their flight \\nappeared to have no pattern, it made a certain kind of sense to the boy. It \\nwas just that he couldn\\'t grasp what it meant. He followed the movement of \\nthe birds, trying to read something into it. Maybe these desert birds could \\nexplain to him the meaning of love without ownership. \\n\\nHe felt sleepy. In his heart, he wanted to remain awake, but he also wanted \\nto sleep. \"I am learning the Language of the World, and everything in the \\nworld is beginning to make sense to meâ€¦ even the flight of the hawks,\" he \\nsaid to himself. And, in that mood, he was grateful to be in love. When you \\nare in love, things make even more sense, he thought. \\n\\nSuddenly, one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky, attacking \\nthe other. As it did so, a sudden, fleeting image came to the boy: an army, \\nwith its swords at the ready, riding into the oasis. The vision vanished \\nimmediately, but it had shaken him. He had heard people speak of mirages, \\nand had already seen some himself: they were desires that, because of their \\nintensity, materialized over the sands of the desert. But he certainly didn\\'t \\ndesire that an army invade the oasis. \\n\\nHe wanted to forget about the vision, and return to his meditation. He tried \\nagain to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert, and its stones. But \\nthere was something there in his heart that wouldn\\'t allow him to do so. \\n\\n\"Always heed the omens,\" the old king had said. The boy recalled what he \\nhad seen in the vision, and sensed that it was actually going to occur. \\n\\nHe rose, and made his way back toward the palm trees. Once again, he \\nperceived the many languages in the things about him: this time, the desert \\nwas safe, and it was the oasis that had become dangerous. \\n\\nThe camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree, observing the \\nsunset. He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes. \\n\\n\"An army is coming,\" the boy said. \"I had a vision.\" \\n\\n\"The desert fills men\\'s hearts with visions,\" the camel driver answered. \\n\\nBut the boy told him about the hawks: that he had been watching their flight \\nand had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 56 / 94\\n\\nThe camel driver understood what the boy was saying. He knew that any \\ngiven thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history of all things. \\nOne could open a book to any page, or look at a person\\'s hand; one could \\nturn a card, or watch the flight of the birdsâ€¦ whatever the thing observed, \\none could find a connection with his experience of the moment. Actually, it \\nwasn\\'t that those things, in themselves, revealed anything at all; it was just \\nthat people, looking at what was occurring around them, could find a means \\nof penetration to the Soul of the World. \\n\\nThe desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with \\nwhich they could penetrate to the Soul of the World. They were known as \\nseers, and they were held in fear by women and the elderly. Tribesmen were \\nalso wary of consulting them, because it would be impossible to be \\neffective in battle if one knew that he was fated to die. The tribesmen \\npreferred the taste of battle, and the thrill of not knowing what the outcome \\nwould be; the future was already written by Allah, and what he had written \\nwas always for the good of man. So the tribesmen lived only for the \\npresent, because the present was full of surprises, and they had to be \\naware of many things: Where was the enemy\\'s sword? Where was his \\nhorse? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive? \\nThe camel driver was not a fighter, and he had consulted with seers. Many \\nof them had been right about what they said, while some had been wrong. \\nThen, one day, the oldest seer he had ever sought out (and the one most to \\nbe feared) had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future. \\n\\n\"Wellâ€¦ so I can do things,\" he had responded. \"And so I can change those \\nthings that I don\\'t want to happen.\" \\n\\n\"But then they wouldn\\'t be a part of your future,\" the seer had said. \\n\\n\"Well, maybe I just want to know the future so I can prepare myself for \\nwhat\\'s coming.\" \\n\\n\"If good things are coming, they will be a pleasant surprise,\" said the seer. \\n\"If bad things are, and you know in advance, you will suffer greatly before \\nthey even occur.\" \\n\\n\"I want to know about the future because I\\'m a man,\" the camel driver had \\nsaid to the seer. \"And men always live their lives based on the future.\" \\n\\nThe seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs; he threw them on the \\nground, and made interpretations based on how they fell. That day, he \\ndidn\\'t make a cast. He wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth and put them \\nback in his bag. \\n\\n\"I make my living forecasting the future for people,\" he said. \"I know the \\nscience of the twigs, and I know how to use them to penetrate to the place \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 57 / 94\\n\\nwhere all is written. There, I can read the past, discover what has already \\nbeen forgotten, and understand the omens that are here in the present. \\n\\n\"When people consult me, it\\'s not that I\\'m reading the future; I am guessing \\nat the future. The future belongs to God, and it is only he who reveals it, \\nunder extraordinary circumstances. How do I guess at the future? Based on \\nthe omens of the present. The secret is here in the present. If you pay \\nattention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on \\nthe present, what comes later will also be better. Forget about the future, \\nand live each day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his \\nchildren. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.\" \\n\\nThe camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God \\nwould allow him to see the future. \\n\\n\"Only when he, himself, reveals it. And God only rarely reveals the future. \\nWhen he does so, it is for only one reason: it\\'s a future that was written so \\nas to be altered.\" \\n\\nGod had shown the boy a part of the future, the camel driver thought. Why \\nwas it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument? \\n\\n\"Go and speak to the tribal chieftains,\" said the camel driver. \"Tell them \\nabout the armies that are approaching.\" \\n\\n\"They\\'ll laugh at me.\" \\n\\n\"They are men of the desert, and the men of the desert are used to dealing \\nwith omens.\" \\n\\n\"Well, then, they probably already know.\" \\n\\n\"They\\'re not concerned with that right now. They believe that if they have to \\nknow about something Allah wants them to know, someone will tell them \\nabout it. It has happened many times before. But, this time, the person is \\nyou.\" \\n\\nThe boy thought of Fatima. And he decided he would go to see the chiefs \\nof the tribes. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe boy approached the guard at the front of the huge white tent at the \\ncenter of the oasis. \\n\\n\"I want to see the chieftains. I\\'ve brought omens from the desert.\" \\n\\nWithout responding, the guard entered the tent, where he remained for \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 58 / 94\\n\\nsome time. When he emerged, it was with a young Arab, dressed in white \\nand gold. The boy told the younger man what he had seen, and the man \\nasked him to wait there. He disappeared into the tent. \\n\\nNight fell, and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and \\nexited the tent. One by one, the campfires were extinguished, and the oasis \\nfell as quiet as the desert. Only the lights in the great tent remained. During \\nall this time, the boy thought about Fatima, and he was still unable to \\nunderstand his last conversation with her. \\n\\nFinally, after hours of waiting, the guard bade the boy enter. The boy was \\nastonished by what he saw inside. Never could he have imagined that, there \\nin the middle of the desert, there existed a tent like this one. The ground \\nwas covered with the most beautiful carpets he had ever walked upon, and \\nfrom the top of the structure hung lamps of hand-wrought gold, each with a \\nlighted candle. The tribal chieftains were seated at the back of the tent in a \\nsemicircle, resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions. Servants came \\nand went with silver trays laden with spices and tea. Other servants \\nmaintained the fires in the hookahs. The atmosphere was suffused with the \\nsweet scent of smoke. \\n\\nThere were eight chieftains, but the boy could see immediately which of \\nthem was the most important: an Arab dressed in white and gold, seated at \\nthe center of the semicircle. At his side was the young Arab the boy had \\nspoken with earlier. \\n\\n\"Who is this stranger who speaks of omens?\" asked one of the chieftains, \\neyeing the boy. \\n\\n\"It is I,\" the boy answered. And he told what he had seen. \\n\\n\"Why would the desert reveal such things to a stranger, when it knows that \\nwe have been here for generations?\" said another of the chieftains. \\n\\n\"Because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert,\" the boy said. \"I \\ncan see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see.\" \\n\\nAnd also because I know about the Soul of the World, he thought to himself.\\n\\n\"The oasis is neutral ground. No one attacks an oasis,\" said a third \\nchieftain. \\n\\n\"I can only tell you what I saw. If you don\\'t want to believe me, you don\\'t \\nhave to do anything about it.\" \\n\\nThe men fell into an animated discussion. They spoke in an Arabic dialect \\nthat the boy didn\\'t understand, but, when he made to leave, the guard told \\nhim to stay. The boy became fearful; the omens told him that something \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 59 / 94\\n\\nwas wrong. He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he \\nhad seen in the desert. \\n\\nSuddenly, the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly, and the boy \\nfelt better. The man hadn\\'t participated in the discussion, and, in fact, \\nhadn\\'t said a word up to that point. But the boy was already used to the \\nLanguage of the World, and he could feel the vibrations of peace \\nthroughout the tent. Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming. \\n\\nThe discussion ended. The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they \\nlistened to what the old man was saying. Then he turned to the boy: this \\ntime his expression was cold and distant. \\n\\n\"Two thousand years ago, in a distant land, a man who believed in dreams \\nwas thrown into a dungeon and then sold as a slave,\" the old man said, \\nnow in the dialect the boy understood. \"Our merchants bought that man, \\nand brought him to Egypt. All of us know that whoever believes in dreams \\nalso knows how to interpret them.\" \\n\\nThe elder continued, \"When the pharaoh dreamed of cows that were thin \\nand cows that were fat, this man I\\'m speaking of rescued Egypt from \\nfamine. His name was Joseph. He, too, was a stranger in a strange land, \\nlike you, and he was probably about your age.\" \\n\\nHe paused, and his eyes were still unfriendly. \\n\\n\"We always observe the Tradition. The Tradition saved Egypt from famine in \\nthose days, and made the Egyptians the wealthiest of peoples. The \\nTradition teaches men how to cross the desert, and how their children \\nshould marry. The Tradition says that an oasis is neutral territory, because \\nboth sides have oases, and so both are vulnerable.\" \\n\\nNo one said a word as the old man continued. \\n\\n\"But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the \\ndesert. Everything we know was taught to us by the desert.\" \\n\\nThe old man gave a signal, and everyone stood. The meeting was over. The \\nhookahs were extinguished, and the guards stood at attention. The boy \\nmade ready to leave, but the old man spoke again: \\n\\n\"Tomorrow, we are going to break the agreement that says that no one at \\nthe oasis may carry arms. Throughout the entire day we will be on the \\nlookout for our enemies. When the sun sets, the men will once again \\nsurrender their arms to me. For every ten dead men among our enemies, \\nyou will receive a piece of gold. \\n\\n\"But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle. Arms are as \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 60 / 94\\n\\ncapricious as the desert, and, if they are not used, the next time they might \\nnot function. If at least one of them hasn\\'t been used by the end of the day \\ntomorrow, one will be used on you.\" \\n\\nWhen the boy left the tent, the oasis was illuminated only by the light of the \\nfull moon. He was twenty minutes from his tent, and began to make his way \\nthere. \\n\\nHe was alarmed by what had happened. He had succeeded in reaching \\nthrough to the Soul of the World, and now the price for having done so \\nmight be his life. It was a frightening bet. But he had been making risky bets \\never since the day he had sold his sheep to pursue his destiny. And, as the \\ncamel driver had said, to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any \\nother day. Every day was there to be lived or to mark one\\'s departure from \\nthis world. Everything depended on one word: \"Maktub.\" \\n\\nWalking along in the silence, he had no regrets. If he died tomorrow, it \\nwould be because God was not willing to change the future. He would at \\nleast have died after having crossed the strait, after having worked in a \\ncrystal shop, and after having known the silence of the desert and Fatima\\'s \\neyes. He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home \\nso long ago. If he died tomorrow, he would already have seen more than \\nother shepherds, and he was proud of that. \\n\\nSuddenly he heard a thundering sound, and he was thrown to the ground by \\na wind such as he had never known. The area was swirling in dust so \\nintense that it hid the moon from view. Before him was an enormous white \\nhorse, rearing over him with a frightening scream. \\n\\nWhen the blinding dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled at what he saw. \\nAstride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in black, with a \\nfalcon perched on his left shoulder. He wore a turban and his entire face, \\nexcept for his eyes, was covered with a black kerchief. He appeared to be a \\nmessenger from the desert, but his presence was much more powerful than \\nthat of a mere messenger. \\n\\nThe strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a scabbard \\nmounted on his saddle. The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the \\nmoon. \\n\\n\"Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks?\" he demanded, \\nso loudly that his words seemed to echo through the fifty thousand palm \\ntrees of Al-Fayoum. \\n\\n\"It is I who dared to do so,\" said the boy. He was reminded of the image of \\nSantiago Matamoros, mounted on his white horse, with the infidels beneath \\nhis hooves. This man looked exactly the same, except that now the roles \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 61 / 94\\n\\nwere reversed. \\n\\n\"It is I who dared to do so,\" he repeated, and he lowered his head to \\nreceive a blow from the sword. \"Many lives will be saved, because I was \\nable to see through to the Soul of the World.\" \\n\\nThe sword didn\\'t fall. Instead, the stranger lowered it slowly, until the point \\ntouched the boy\\'s forehead. It drew a droplet of blood. \\n\\nThe horseman was completely immobile, as was the boy. It didn\\'t even \\noccur to the boy to flee. In his heart, he felt a strange sense of joy: he was \\nabout to die in pursuit of his destiny. And for Fatima. The omens had been \\ntrue, after all. Here he was, face-to-face with his enemy, but there was no \\nneed to be concerned about dyingâ€”the Soul of the World awaited him, and \\nhe would soon be a part of it. And, tomorrow, his enemy would also be \\napart of that Soul. \\n\\nThe stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy\\'s forehead. \"Why did \\nyou read the flight of the birds?\" \\n\\n\"I read only what the birds wanted to tell me. They wanted to save the oasis. \\nTomorrow all of you will die, because there are more men at the oasis than \\nyou have.\" \\n\\nThe sword remained where it was. \"Who are you to change what Allah has \\nwilled?\" \\n\\n\"Allah created the armies, and he also created the hawks. Allah taught me \\nthe language of the birds. Everything has been written by the same hand,\" \\nthe boy said, remembering the camel driver\\'s words. \\n\\nThe stranger withdrew the sword from the boy\\'s forehead, and the boy felt \\nimmensely relieved. But he still couldn\\'t flee. \\n\\n\"Be careful with your prognostications,\" said the stranger. \"When something \\nis written, there is no way to change it.\" \\n\\n\"All I saw was an army,\" said the boy. \"I didn\\'t see the outcome of the \\nbattle.\" \\n\\nThe stranger seemed satisfied with the answer. But he kept the sword in his \\nhand. \"What is a stranger doing in a strange land?\" \\n\\n\"I am following my destiny. It\\'s not something you would understand.\" \\n\\nThe stranger placed his sword in its scabbard, and the boy relaxed. \\n\\n\"I had to test your courage,\" the stranger said. \"Courage is the quality most \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 62 / 94\\n\\nessential to understanding the Language of the World.\" \\n\\nThe boy was surprised. The stranger was speaking of things that very few \\npeople knew about. \\n\\n\"You must not let up, even after having come so far,\" he continued. \"You \\nmust love the desert, but never trust it completely. Because the desert tests \\nall men: it challenges every step, and kills those who become distracted.\" \\n\\nWhat he said reminded the boy of the old king. \\n\\n\"If the warriors come here, and your head is still on your shoulders at \\nsunset, come and find me,\" said the stranger. \\n\\nThe same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip. The horse \\nreared again, raising a cloud of dust. \\n\\n\"Where do you live?\" shouted the boy, as the horseman rode away. \\n\\nThe hand with the whip pointed to the south. \\n\\nThe boy had met the alchemist. \\n\\n* \\n\\nNext morning, there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout \\nthe palm trees at Al-Fayoum. Before the sun had reached its high point, five \\nhundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon. The mounted troops entered \\nthe oasis from the north; it appeared to be a peaceful expedition, but they \\nall carried arms hidden in their robes. When they reached the white tent at \\nthe center of Al-Fayoum, they withdrew their scimitars and rifles. And they \\nattacked an empty tent. \\n\\nThe men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within \\nhalf an hour all but one of the intruders were dead. The children had been \\nkept at the other side of a grove of palm trees, and saw nothing of what had \\nhappened. The women had remained in their tents, praying for the \\nsafekeeping of their husbands, and saw nothing of the battle, either. Were it \\nnot for the bodies there on the ground, it would have appeared to be a \\nnormal day at the oasis. \\n\\nThe only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion. That \\nafternoon, he was brought before the tribal chieftains, who asked him why \\nhe had violated the Tradition. The commander said that his men had been \\nstarving and thirsty, exhausted from many days of battle, and had decided \\nto take the oasis so as to be able to return to the war. \\n\\nThe tribal chieftain said that he felt sorry for the tribesmen, but that the \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 63 / 94\\n\\nTradition was sacred. He condemned the commander to death without \\nhonor. Rather than being killed by a blade or a bullet, he was hanged from a \\ndead palm tree, where his body twisted in the desert wind. \\n\\nThe tribal chieftain called for the boy, and presented him with fifty pieces of \\ngold. He repeated his story about Joseph of Egypt, and asked the boy to \\nbecome the counselor of the oasis. \\n\\n* \\n\\nWhen the sun had set, and the first stars made their appearance, the boy \\nstarted to walk to the south. He eventually sighted a single tent, and a \\ngroup of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by \\ngenies. But the boy sat down and waited. \\n\\nNot until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view. He carried two \\ndead hawks over his shoulder. \\n\\n\"I am here,\" the boy said. \\n\\n\"You shouldn\\'t be here,\" the alchemist answered. \"Or is it your destiny that \\nbrings you here?\" \\n\\n\"With the wars between the tribes, it\\'s impossible to cross the desert. So I \\nhave come here.\" \\n\\nThe alchemist dismounted from his horse, and signaled that the boy should \\nenter the tent with him. It was a tent like many at the oasis. The boy looked \\naround for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy, but saw none. \\nThere were only some books in a pile, a small cooking stove, and the \\ncarpets, covered with mysterious designs. \\n\\n\"Sit down. We\\'ll have something to drink and eat these hawks,\" said the \\nalchemist. \\n\\nThe boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen on the day \\nbefore, but he said nothing. The alchemist lighted the fire, and soon a \\ndelicious aroma filled the tent. It was better than the scent of the hookahs. \\n\\n\"Why did you want to see me?\" the boy asked. \\n\\n\"Because of the omens,\" the alchemist answered. \"The wind told me you \\nwould be coming, and that you would need help.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s not I the wind spoke about. It\\'s the other foreigner, the Englishman. \\nHe\\'s the one that\\'s looking for you.\" \\n\\n\"He has other things to do first. But he\\'s on the right track. He has begun to \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 64 / 94\\n\\ntry to understand the desert.\" \\n\\n\"And what about me?\" \\n\\n\"When a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help \\nthat person to realize his dream,\" said the alchemist, echoing the words of \\nthe old king. The boy understood. Another person was there to help him \\ntoward his destiny. \\n\\n\"So you are going to instruct me?\" \\n\\n\"No. You already know all you need to know. I am only going to point you in \\nthe direction of your treasure.\" \\n\\n\"But there\\'s a tribal war,\" the boy reiterated. \\n\\n\"I know what\\'s happening in the desert.\" \\n\\n\"I have already found my treasure. I have a camel, I have my money from \\nthe crystal shop, and I have fifty gold pieces. In my own country, I would be \\na rich man.\" \\n\\n\"But none of that is from the Pyramids,\" said the alchemist. \\n\\n\"I also have Fatima. She is a treasure greater than anything else I have \\nwon.\" \\n\\n\"She wasn\\'t found at the Pyramids, either.\" \\n\\nThey ate in silence. The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid \\ninto the boy\\'s cup. It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted. \\n\\n\"Isn\\'t wine prohibited here?\" the boy asked \\n\\n\"It\\'s not what enters men\\'s mouths that\\'s evil,\" said the alchemist. \"It\\'s what \\ncomes out of their mouths that is.\" \\n\\nThe alchemist was a bit daunting, but, as the boy drank the wine, he \\nrelaxed. After they finished eating they sat outside the tent, under a moon \\nso brilliant that it made the stars pale. \\n\\n\"Drink and enjoy yourself,\" said the alchemist, noticing that the boy was \\nfeeling happier. \"Rest well tonight, as if you were a warrior preparing for \\ncombat. Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your \\ntreasure. You\\'ve got to find the treasure, so that everything you have \\nlearned along the way can make sense. \\n\\n\"Tomorrow, sell your camel and buy a horse. Camels are traitorous: they \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 65 / 94\\n\\nwalk thousands of paces and never seem to tire. Then suddenly, they kneel \\nand die. But horses tire bit by bit. You always know how much you can ask \\nof them, and when it is that they are about to die.\" \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe following night, the boy appeared at the alchemist\\'s tent with a horse. \\nThe alchemist was ready, and he mounted his own steed and placed the \\nfalcon on his left shoulder. He said to the boy, \"Show me where there is life \\nout in the desert. Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find \\ntreasure.\" \\n\\nThey began to ride out over the sands, with the moon lighting their way. I \\ndon\\'t know if I\\'ll be able to find life in the desert, the boy thought. I don\\'t \\nknow the desert that well yet. \\n\\nHe wanted to say so to the alchemist, but he was afraid of the man. They \\nreached the rocky place where the boy had seen the hawks in the sky, but \\nnow there was only silence and the wind. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know how to find life in the desert,\" the boy said. \"I know that there \\nis life here, but I don\\'t know where to look.\" \\n\\n\"Life attracts life,\" the alchemist answered. \\n\\nAnd then the boy understood. He loosened the reins on his horse, who \\ngalloped forward over the rocks and sand. The alchemist followed as the \\nboy\\'s horse ran for almost half an hour. They could no longer see the palms \\nof the oasisâ€”only the gigantic moon above them, and its silver reflections \\nfrom the stones of the desert. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the boy\\'s \\nhorse began to slow. \\n\\n\"There\\'s life here,\" the boy said to the alchemist. \"I don\\'t know the language \\nof the desert, but my horse knows the language of life.\" \\n\\nThey dismounted, and the alchemist said nothing. Advancing slowly, they \\nsearched among the stones. The alchemist stopped abruptly, and bent to \\nthe ground. There was a hole there among the stones. The alchemist put his \\nhand into the hole, and then his entire arm, up to his shoulder. Something \\nwas moving there, and the alchemist\\'s eyesâ€”the boy could see only his \\neyes-squinted with his effort. His arm seemed to be battling with whatever \\nwas in the hole. Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his \\narm and leaped to his feet. In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail. \\n\\nThe boy leapt as well, but away from the alchemist. The snake fought \\nfrantically, making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert. It \\nwas a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in minutes. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 66 / 94\\n\\n\"Watch out for his venom,\" the boy said. But even though the alchemist had \\nput his hand in the hole, and had surely already been bitten, his expression \\nwas calm. \"The alchemist is two hundred years old,\" the Englishman had \\ntold him. He must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert. \\n\\nThe boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a \\nscimitar. With its blade, he drew a circle in the sand, and then he placed the \\nsnake within it. The serpent relaxed immediately. \\n\\n\"Not to worry,\" said the alchemist. \"He won\\'t leave the circle. You found life \\nin the desert, the omen that I needed.\" \\n\\n\"Why was that so important?\" \\n\\n\"Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert.\" \\n\\nThe boy didn\\'t want to talk about the Pyramids. His heart was heavy, and he \\nhad been melancholy since the previous night. To continue his search for \\nthe treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima. \\n\\n\"I\\'m going to guide you across the desert,\" the alchemist said. \\n\\n\"I want to stay at the oasis,\" the boy answered. \"I\\'ve found Fatima, and, as \\nfar as I\\'m concerned, she\\'s worth more than treasure.\" \\n\\n\"Fatima is a woman of the desert,\" said the alchemist. \"She knows that men \\nhave to go away in order to return. And she already has her treasure: it\\'s \\nyou. Now she expects that you will find what it is you\\'re looking for.\" \\n\\n\"Well, what if I decide to stay?\" \\n\\n\"Let me tell you what will happen. You\\'ll be the counselor of the oasis. You \\nhave enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels. You\\'ll marry \\nFatima, and you\\'ll both be happy for a year. You\\'ll learn to love the desert, \\nand you\\'ll get to know every one of the fifty thousand palms. You\\'ll watch \\nthem as they grow, demonstrating how the world is always changing. And \\nyou\\'ll get better and better at understanding omens, because the desert is \\nthe best teacher there is. \\n\\n\"Sometime during the second year, you\\'ll remember about the treasure. The \\nomens will begin insistently to speak of it, and you\\'ll try to ignore them. \\nYou\\'ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants. \\nThe tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do. And your camels will bring \\nyou wealth and power. \\n\\n\"During the third year, the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and \\nyour destiny. You\\'ll walk around, night after night, at the oasis, and Fatima \\nwill be unhappy because she\\'ll feel it was she who interrupted your quest. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 67 / 94\\n\\nBut you will love her, and she\\'ll return your love. You\\'ll remember that she \\nnever asked you to stay, because a woman of the desert knows that she \\nmust await her man. So you won\\'t blame her. But many times you\\'ll walk the \\nsands of the desert, thinking that maybe you could have leftâ€¦ that you \\ncould have trusted more in your love for Fatima. Because what kept you at \\nthe oasis was your own fear that you might never come back. At that point, \\nthe omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever. \\n\\n\"Then, sometime during the fourth year, the omens will abandon you, \\nbecause you\\'ve stopped listening to them. The tribal chieftains will see that, \\nand you\\'ll be dismissed from your position as counselor. But, by then, you\\'ll \\nbe a rich merchant, with many camels and a great deal of merchandise. \\nYou\\'ll spend the rest of your days knowing that you didn\\'t pursue your \\ndestiny, and that now it\\'s too late. \\n\\n\"You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his \\ndestiny. If he abandons that pursuit, it\\'s because it wasn\\'t true loveâ€¦ the \\nlove that speaks the Language of the World.\" \\n\\nThe alchemist erased the circle in the sand, and the snake slithered away \\namong the rocks. The boy remembered the crystal merchant who had \\nalways wanted to go to Mecca, and the Englishman in search of the \\nalchemist. He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert. And he \\nlooked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved. \\n\\nThey mounted their horses, and this time it was the boy who followed the \\nalchemist back to the oasis. The wind brought the sounds of the oasis to \\nthem, and the boy tried to hear Fatima\\'s voice. \\n\\nBut that night, as he had watched the cobra within the circle, the strange \\nhorseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of love and treasure, \\nof the women of the desert and of his destiny. \\n\\n\"I\\'m going with you,\" the boy said. And he immediately felt peace in his \\nheart. \\n\\n\"We\\'ll leave tomorrow before sunrise,\" was the alchemist\\'s only response. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe boy spent a sleepless night. Two hours before dawn, he awoke one of \\nthe boys who slept in his tent, and asked him to show him where Fatima \\nlived. They went to her tent, and the boy gave his friend enough gold to buy \\na sheep. \\n\\nThen he asked his friend to go to into the tent where Fatima was sleeping, \\nand to awaken her and tell her that he was waiting outside. The young Arab \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 68 / 94\\n\\ndid as he was asked, and was given enough gold to buy yet another sheep. \\n\\n\"Now leave us alone,\" said the boy to the young Arab. The Arab returned to \\nhis tent to sleep, proud to have helped the counselor of the oasis, and \\nhappy at having enough money to buy himself some sheep. \\n\\nFatima appeared at the entrance to the tent. The two walked out among the \\npalms. The boy knew that it was a violation of the Tradition, but that didn\\'t \\nmatter to him now. \\n\\n\"I\\'m going away,\" he said. \"And I want you to know that I\\'m coming back. I \\nlove you becauseâ€¦\" \\n\\n\"Don\\'t say anything,\" Fatima interrupted. \"One is loved because one is \\nloved. No reason is needed for loving.\" \\n\\nBut the boy continued, \"I had a dream, and I met with a king. I sold crystal \\nand crossed the desert. And, because the tribes declared war, I went to the \\nwell, seeking the alchemist. So, I love you because the entire universe \\nconspired to help me find you.\" \\n\\nThe two embraced. It was the first time either had touched the other. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll be back,\" the boy said. \\n\\n\"Before this, I always looked to the desert with longing,\" said Fatima. \"Now \\nit will be with hope. My father went away one day, but he returned to my \\nmother, and he has always come back since then.\" \\n\\nThey said nothing else. They walked a bit farther among the palms, and \\nthen the boy left her at the entrance to her tent. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll return, just as your father came back to your mother,\" he said. \\n\\nHe saw that Fatima\\'s eyes were filled with tears. \\n\\n\"You\\'re crying?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m a woman of the desert,\" she said, averting her face. \"But above all, I\\'m \\na woman.\" \\n\\nFatima went back to her tent, and, when daylight came, she went out to do \\nthe chores she had done for years. But everything had changed. The boy \\nwas no longer at the oasis, and the oasis would never again have the same \\nmeaning it had had only yesterday. It would no longer be a place with fifty \\nthousand palm trees and three hundred wells, where the pilgrims arrived, \\nrelieved at the end of their long journeys. From that day on, the oasis would \\nbe an empty place for her. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 69 / 94\\n\\nFrom that day on, it was the desert that would be important. She would look \\nto it every day, and would try to guess which star the boy was following in \\nsearch of his treasure. She would have to send her kisses on the wind, \\nhoping that the wind would touch the boy\\'s face, and would tell him that \\nshe was alive. That she was waiting for him, a woman awaiting a \\ncourageous man in search of his treasure. From that day on, the desert \\nwould represent only one thing to her: the hope for his return. \\n\\n* \\n\\n\"Don\\'t think about what you\\'ve left behind,\" the alchemist said to the boy as \\nthey began to ride across the sands of the desert. \"Everything is written in \\nthe Soul of the World, and there it will stay forever.\" \\n\\n\"Men dream more about coming home than about leaving,\" the boy said. He \\nwas already reaccustomed to desert\\'s silence. \\n\\n\"If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And one can \\nalways come back. If what you had found was only a moment of light, like \\nthe explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return.\" \\n\\nThe man was speaking the language of alchemy. But the boy knew that he \\nwas referring to Fatima. \\n\\nIt was difficult not to think about what he had left behind. The desert, with \\nits endless monotony, put him to dreaming. The boy could still see the palm \\ntrees, the wells, and the face of the woman he loved. He could see the \\nEnglishman at his experiments, and the camel driver who was a teacher \\nwithout realizing it. Maybe the alchemist has never been in love, the boy \\nthought. \\n\\nThe alchemist rode in front, with the falcon on his shoulder. The bird knew \\nthe language of the desert well, and whenever they stopped, he flew off in \\nsearch of game. On the first day he returned with a rabbit, and on the \\nsecond with two birds. \\n\\nAt night, they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden. The \\ndesert nights were cold, and were becoming darker and darker as the \\nphases of the moon passed. They went on for a week, speaking only of the \\nprecautions they needed to follow in order to avoid the battles between the \\ntribes. The war continued, and at times the wind carried the sweet, sickly \\nsmell of blood. Battles had been fought nearby, and the wind reminded the \\nboy that there was the language of omens, always ready to show him what \\nhis eyes had failed to observe. \\n\\nOn the seventh day, the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual. \\nThe falcon flew off to find game, and the alchemist offered his water \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 70 / 94\\n\\ncontainer to the boy. \\n\\n\"You are almost at the end of your journey,\" said the alchemist. \"I \\ncongratulate you for having pursued your destiny.\" \\n\\n\"And you\\'ve told me nothing along the way,\" said the boy. \"I thought you \\nwere going to teach me some of the things you know. A while ago, I rode \\nthrough the desert with a man who had books on alchemy. But I wasn\\'t able \\nto learn anything from them.\" \\n\\n\"There is only one way to learn,\" the alchemist answered. \"It\\'s through \\naction. Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey. \\nYou need to learn only one thing more.\" \\n\\nThe boy wanted to know what that was, but the alchemist was searching the \\nhorizon, looking for the falcon. \\n\\n\"Why are you called the alchemist?\" \\n\\n\"Because that\\'s what I am.\" \\n\\n\"And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were \\nunable to do so?\" \\n\\n\"They were looking only for gold,\" his companion answered. \"They were \\nseeking the treasure of their destiny, without wanting actually to live out the \\ndestiny.\" \\n\\n\"What is it that I still need to know?\" the boy asked. \\n\\nBut the alchemist continued to look to the horizon. And finally the falcon \\nreturned with their meal. They dug a hole and lit their fire in it, so that the \\nlight of the flames would not be seen. \\n\\n\"I\\'m an alchemist simply because I\\'m an alchemist,\" he said, as he prepared \\nthe meal. \"I learned the science from my grandfather, who learned from his \\nfather, and so on, back to the creation of the world. In those times, the \\nMaster Work could be written simply on an emerald. But men began to \\nreject simple things, and to write tracts, interpretations, and philosophical \\nstudies. They also began to feel that they knew a better way than others \\nhad. Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today.\" \\n\\n\"What was written on the Emerald Tablet?\" the boy wanted to know. \\n\\nThe alchemist began to draw in the sand, and completed his drawing in less \\nthan five minutes. As he drew, the boy thought of the old king, and the \\nplaza where they had met that day; it seemed as if it had taken place years \\nand years ago. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 71 / 94\\n\\n\"This is what was written on the Emerald Tablet,\" said the alchemist, when \\nhe had finished. \\n\\nThe boy tried to read what was written in the sand. \\n\\n\"It\\'s a code,\" said the boy, a bit disappointed. \"It looks like what I saw in the \\nEnglishman\\'s books.\" \\n\\n\"No,\" the alchemist answered. \"It\\'s like the flight of those two hawks; it can\\'t \\nbe understood by reason alone. The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to \\nthe Soul of the World. \\n\\n\"The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a \\ncopy of paradise. The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that \\nthere exists a world that is perfect. God created the world so that, through \\nits visible objects, men could understand his spiritual teachings and the \\nmarvels of his wisdom. That\\'s what I mean by action.\" \\n\\n\"Should I understand the Emerald Tablet?\" the boy asked. \\n\\n\"Perhaps, if you were in a laboratory of alchemy, this would be the right time \\nto study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet. But you are in the \\ndesert. So immerse yourself in it. The desert will give you an understanding \\nof the world; in fact, anything on the face of the earth will do that. You don\\'t \\neven have to understand the desert: all you have to do is contemplate a \\nsimple grain of sand, and you will see in it all the marvels of creation.\" \\n\\n\"How do I immerse myself in the desert?\" \\n\\n\"Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the Soul of \\nthe World, and it will one day return there.\" \\n\\n* \\n\\nThey crossed the desert for another two days in silence. The alchemist had \\nbecome much more cautious, because they were approaching the area \\nwhere the most violent battles were being waged. As they moved along, the \\nboy tried to listen to his heart. \\n\\nIt was not easy to do; in earlier times, his heart had always been ready to \\ntell its story, but lately that wasn\\'t true. There had been times when his heart \\nspent hours telling of its sadness, and at other times it became so \\nemotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears. His \\nheart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy of treasure, and more slowly \\nwhen the boy stared entranced at the endless horizons of the desert. But \\nhis heart was never quiet, even when the boy and the alchemist had fallen \\ninto silence. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 72 / 94\\n\\n\"Why do we have to listen to our hearts?\" the boy asked, when they had \\nmade camp that day. \\n\\n\"Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you\\'ll find your treasure.\" \\n\\n\"But my heart is agitated,\" the boy said. \"It has its dreams, it gets \\nemotional, and it\\'s become passionate over a woman of the desert. It asks \\nthings of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, when I\\'m thinking \\nabout her.\" \\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has to say.\" \\n\\nDuring the next three days, the two travelers passed by a number of armed \\ntribesmen, and saw others on the horizon. The boy\\'s heart began to speak \\nof fear. It told him stories it had heard from the Soul of the World, stories of \\nmen who sought to find their treasure and never succeeded. Sometimes it \\nfrightened the boy with the idea that he might not find his treasure, or that \\nhe might die there in the desert. At other times, it told the boy that it was \\nsatisfied: it had found love and riches. \\n\\n\"My heart is a traitor,\" the boy said to the alchemist, when they had paused \\nto rest the horses. \"It doesn\\'t want me to go on.\" \\n\\n\"That makes sense,\" the alchemist answered. \"Naturally it\\'s afraid that, in \\npursuing your dream, you might lose everything you\\'ve won.\" \\n\\n\"Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?\" \\n\\n\"Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you pretend \\nnot to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there inside you, \\nrepeating to you what you\\'re thinking about life and about the world.\" \\n\\n\"You mean I should listen, even if it\\'s treasonous?\" \\n\\n\"Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your heart well, it \\nwill never be able to do that to you. Because you\\'ll know its dreams and \\nwishes, and will know how to deal with them. \\n\\n\"You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it\\'s better to listen to \\nwhat it has to say. That way, you\\'ll never have to fear an unanticipated \\nblow.\" \\n\\nThe boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert. He \\ncame to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it as it was. He \\nlost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to the oasis, because, \\none afternoon, his heart told him that it was happy. \"Even though I complain \\nsometimes,\" it said, \"it\\'s because I\\'m the heart of a person, and people\\'s \\nhearts are that way. People are afraid to pursue their most important \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 73 / 94\\n\\ndreams, because they feel that they don\\'t deserve them, or that they\\'ll be \\nunable to achieve them. We, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of \\nloved ones who go away forever, or of moments that could have been good \\nbut weren\\'t, or of treasures that might have been found but were forever \\nhidden in the sands. Because, when these things happen, we suffer \\nterribly.\" \\n\\n\"My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,\" the boy told the alchemist one \\nnight as they looked up at the moonless sky. \\n\\n\"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. \\nAnd that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, \\nbecause every second of the search is a second\\'s encounter with God and \\nwith eternity.\" \\n\\n\"Every second of the search is an encounter with God,\" the boy told his \\nheart. \"When I have been truly searching for my treasure, every day has \\nbeen luminous, because I\\'ve known that every hour was a part of the dream \\nthat I would find it. When I have been truly searching for my treasure, I\\'ve \\ndiscovered things along the way that I never would have seen had I not had \\nthe courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to \\nachieve.\" \\n\\nSo his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon. That night, the boy slept \\ndeeply, and, when he awoke, his heart began to tell him things that came \\nfrom the Soul of the World. It said that all people who are happy have God \\nwithin them. And that happiness could be found in a grain of sand from the \\ndesert, as the alchemist had said. Because a grain of sand is a moment of \\ncreation, and the universe has taken millions of years to create it. \"Everyone \\non earth has a treasure that awaits him,\" his heart said. \"We, people\\'s \\nhearts, seldom say much about those treasures, because people no longer \\nwant to go in search of them. We speak of them only to children. Later, we \\nsimply let life proceed, in its own direction, toward its own fate. But, \\nunfortunately, very few follow the path laid out for themâ€”the path to their \\ndestinies, and to happiness. Most people see the world as a threatening \\nplace, and, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a \\nthreatening place. \\n\\n\"So, we, their hearts, speak more and more softly. We never stop speaking \\nout, but we begin to hope that our words won\\'t be heard: we don\\'t want \\npeople to suffer because they don\\'t follow their hearts.\" \\n\\n\"Why don\\'t people\\'s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams?\" the \\nboy asked the alchemist. \\n\\n\"Because that\\'s what makes a heart suffer most, and hearts don\\'t like to \\nsuffer.\" \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 74 / 94\\n\\nFrom then on, the boy understood his heart. He asked it, please, never to \\nstop speaking to him. He asked that, when he wandered far from his \\ndreams, his heart press him and sound the alarm. The boy swore that, every \\ntime he heard the alarm, he would heed its message. \\n\\nThat night, he told all of this to the alchemist. And the alchemist understood \\nthat the boy\\'s heart had returned to the Soul of the World. \\n\\n\"So what should I do now?\" the boy asked. \\n\\n\"Continue in the direction of the Pyramids,\" said the alchemist. \"And \\ncontinue to pay heed to the omens. Your heart is still capable of showing \\nyou where the treasure is.\" \\n\\n\"Is that the one thing I still needed to know?\" \\n\\n\"No,\" the alchemist answered. \"What you still need to know is this: before a \\ndream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned \\nalong the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in \\naddition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we\\'ve learned as we\\'ve \\nmoved toward that dream. That\\'s the point at which most people give up. \\nIt\\'s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one \\'dies of \\nthirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.\\' \\n\\n\"Every search begins with beginner\\'s luck. And every search ends with the \\nvictor\\'s being severely tested.\" \\n\\nThe boy remembered an old proverb from his country. It said that the \\ndarkest hour of the night came just before the dawn. \\n\\n* \\n\\nOn the following day, the first clear sign of danger appeared. Three armed \\ntribesmen approached, and asked what the boy and the alchemist were \\ndoing there. \\n\\n\"I\\'m hunting with my falcon,\" the alchemist answered. \\n\\n\"We\\'re going to have to search you to see whether you\\'re armed,\" one of \\nthe tribesmen said. \\n\\nThe alchemist dismounted slowly, and the boy did the same. \\n\\n\"Why are you carrying money?\" asked the tribesman, when he had searched \\nthe boy\\'s bag. \\n\\n\"I need it to get to the Pyramids,\" he said. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 75 / 94\\n\\nThe tribesman who was searching the alchemist\\'s belongings found a small \\ncrystal flask filled with a liquid, and a yellow glass egg that was slightly \\nlarger than a chicken\\'s egg. \\n\\n\"What are these things?\" he asked. \\n\\n\"That\\'s the Philosopher\\'s Stone and the Elixir of Life. It\\'s the Master Work of \\nthe alchemists. Whoever swallows that elixir will never be sick again, and a \\nfragment from that stone turns any metal into gold.\" \\n\\nThe Arabs laughed at him, and the alchemist laughed along. They thought \\nhis answer was amusing, and they allowed the boy and the alchemist to \\nproceed with all of their belongings. \\n\\n\"Are you crazy?\" the boy asked the alchemist, when they had moved on. \\n\"What did you do that for?\" \\n\\n\"To show you one of life\\'s simple lessons,\" the alchemist answered. \"When \\nyou possess great treasures within you, and try to tell others of them, \\nseldom are you believed.\" \\n\\nThey continued across the desert. With every day that passed, the boy\\'s \\nheart became more and more silent. It no longer wanted to know about \\nthings of the past or future; it was content simply to contemplate the desert, \\nand to drink with the boy from the Soul of the World. The boy and his heart \\nhad become friends, and neither was capable now of betraying the other. \\n\\nWhen his heart spoke to him, it was to provide a stimulus to the boy, and to \\ngive him strength, because the days of silence there in the desert were \\nwearisome. His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were: his \\ncourage in having given up his sheep and in trying to live out his destiny, \\nand his enthusiasm during the time he had worked at the crystal shop. \\n\\nAnd his heart told him something else that the boy had never noticed: it told \\nthe boy of dangers that had threatened him, but that he had never \\nperceived. His heart said that one time it had hidden the rifle the boy had \\ntaken from his father, because of the possibility that the boy might wound \\nhimself. And it reminded the boy of the day when he had been ill and \\nvomiting out in the fields, after which he had fallen into a deep sleep. There \\nhad been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy\\'s \\nsheep and murder him. But, since the boy hadn\\'t passed by, they had \\ndecided to move on, thinking that he had changed his route. \\n\\n\"Does a man\\'s heart always help him?\" the boy asked the alchemist. \\n\\n\"Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies. But \\nthey do help children, drunkards, and the elderly, too.\" \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 76 / 94\\n\\n\"Does that mean that I\\'ll never run into danger?\" \\n\\n\"It means only that the heart does what it can,\" the alchemist said. \\n\\nOne afternoon, they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes. At \\neach corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful white robes, with \\narms at the ready. The men were smoking their hookahs and trading stories \\nfrom the battlefield. No one paid any attention to the two travelers. \\n\\n\"There\\'s no danger,\" the boy said, when they had moved on past the \\nencampment. \\n\\nThe alchemist sounded angry: \"Trust in your heart, but never forget that \\nyou\\'re in the desert. When men are at war with one another, the Soul of the \\nWorld can hear the screams of battle. No one fails to suffer the \\nconsequences of everything under the sun.\" \\n\\nAll things are one, the boy thought. And then, as if the desert wanted to \\ndemonstrate that the alchemist was right, two horsemen appeared from \\nbehind the travelers. \\n\\n\"You can\\'t go any farther,\" one of them said. \"You\\'re in the area where the \\ntribes are at war.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m not going very far,\" the alchemist answered, looking straight into the \\neyes of the horsemen. They were silent for a moment, and then agreed that \\nthe boy and the alchemist could move along. \\n\\nThe boy watched the exchange with fascination. \"You dominated those \\nhorsemen with the way you looked at them,\" he said. \\n\\n\"Your eyes show the strength of your soul,\" answered the alchemist. \\n\\nThat\\'s true, the boy thought. He had noticed that, in the midst of the \\nmultitude of armed men back at the encampment, there had been one who \\nstared fixedly at the two. He had been so far away that his face wasn\\'t even \\nvisible. But the boy was certain that he had been looking at them. \\n\\nFinally, when they had crossed the mountain range that extended along the \\nentire horizon, the alchemist said that they were only two days from the \\nPyramids. \\n\\n\"If we\\'re going to go our separate ways soon,\" the boy said, \"then teach me \\nabout alchemy.\" \\n\\n\"You already know about alchemy. It is about penetrating to the Soul of the \\nWorld, and discovering the treasure that has been reserved for you.\" \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 77 / 94\\n\\n\"No, that\\'s not what I mean. I\\'m talking about transforming lead into gold.\" \\n\\nThe alchemist fell as silent as the desert, and answered the boy only after \\nthey had stopped to eat. \\n\\n\"Everything in the universe evolved,\" he said. \"And, for wise men, gold is the \\nmetal that evolved the furthest. Don\\'t ask me why; I don\\'t know why. I just \\nknow that the Tradition is always right. \\n\\n\"Men have never understood the words of the wise. So gold, instead of \\nbeing seen as a symbol of evolution, became the basis for conflict.\" \\n\\n\"There are many languages spoken by things,\" the boy said. \"There was a \\ntime when, for me, a camel\\'s whinnying was nothing more than whinnying. \\nThen it became a signal of danger. And, finally, it became just a whinny \\nagain.\" \\n\\nBut then he stopped. The alchemist probably already knew all that. \\n\\n\"I have known true alchemists,\" the alchemist continued. \"They locked \\nthemselves in their laboratories, and tried to evolve, as gold had. And they \\nfound the Philosopher\\'s Stone, because they understood that when \\nsomething evolves, everything around that thing evolves as well. \\n\\n\"Others stumbled upon the stone by accident. They already had the gift, \\nand their souls were readier for such things than the souls of others. But \\nthey don\\'t count. They\\'re quite rare. \\n\\n\"And then there were the others, who were interested only in gold. They \\nnever found the secret. They forgot that lead, copper, and iron have their \\nown destinies to fulfill. And anyone who interferes with the destiny of \\nanother thing never will discover his own.\" \\n\\nThe alchemist\\'s words echoed out like a curse. He reached over and picked \\nup a shell from the ground. \\n\\n\"This desert was once a sea,\" he said. \\n\\n\"I noticed that,\" the boy answered. \\n\\nThe alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear. He had done that \\nmany times when he was a child, and had heard the sound of the sea. \\n\\n\"The sea has lived on in this shell, because that\\'s its destiny. And it will \\nnever cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water.\" \\n\\nThey mounted their horses, and rode out in the direction of the Pyramids of \\nEgypt. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 78 / 94\\n\\n* \\n\\nThe sun was setting when the boy\\'s heart sounded a danger signal. They \\nwere surrounded by gigantic dunes, and the boy looked at the alchemist to \\nsee whether he had sensed anything. But he appeared to be unaware of any \\ndanger. Five minutes later, the boy saw two horsemen waiting ahead of \\nthem. Before he could say anything to the alchemist, the two horsemen had \\nbecome ten, and then a hundred. And then they were everywhere in the \\ndunes. \\n\\nThey were tribesmen dressed in blue, with black rings surrounding their \\nturbans. Their faces were hidden behind blue veils, with only their eyes \\nshowing. \\n\\nEven from a distance, their eyes conveyed the strength of their souls. And \\ntheir eyes spoke of death. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe two were taken to a nearby military camp. A soldier shoved the boy and \\nthe alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his \\nstaff. \\n\\n\"These are the spies,\" said one of the men. \\n\\n\"We\\'re just travelers,\" the alchemist answered. \\n\\n\"You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago. And you were talking \\nwith one of the troops there.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars,\" said the \\nalchemist. \"I have no information about troops or about the movement of \\nthe tribes. I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here.\" \\n\\n\"Who is your friend?\" the chief asked. \\n\\n\"An alchemist,\" said the alchemist. \"He understands the forces of nature. \\nAnd he wants to show you his extraordinary powers.\" \\n\\nThe boy listened quietly. And fearfully. \\n\\n\"What is a foreigner doing here?\" asked another of the men. \\n\\n\"He has brought money to give to your tribe,\" said the alchemist, before the \\nboy could say a word. And seizing the boy\\'s bag, the alchemist gave the \\ngold coins to the chief. \\n\\nThe Arab accepted them without a word. There was enough there to buy a \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 79 / 94\\n\\nlot of weapons. \\n\\n\"What is an alchemist?\" he asked, finally. \\n\\n\"It\\'s a man who understands nature and the world. If he wanted to, he could \\ndestroy this camp just with the force of the wind.\" \\n\\nThe men laughed. They were used to the ravages of war, and knew that the \\nwind could not deliver them a fatal blow. Yet each felt his heart beat a bit \\nfaster. They were men of the desert, and they were fearful of sorcerers. \\n\\n\"I want to see him do it,\" said the chief. \\n\\n\"He needs three days,\" answered the alchemist. \"He is going to transform \\nhimself into the wind, just to demonstrate his powers. If he can\\'t do so, we \\nhumbly offer you our lives, for the honor of your tribe.\" \\n\\n\"You can\\'t offer me something that is already mine,\" the chief said, \\narrogantly. But he granted the travelers three days. \\n\\nThe boy was shaking with fear, but the alchemist helped him out of the tent.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let them see that you\\'re afraid,\" the alchemist said. \"They are brave \\nmen, and they despise cowards.\" \\n\\nBut the boy couldn\\'t even speak. He was able to do so only after they had \\nwalked through the center of the camp. There was no need to imprison \\nthem: the Arabs simply confiscated their horses. So, once again, the world \\nhad demonstrated its many languages: the desert only moments ago had \\nbeen endless and free, and now it was an impenetrable wall. \\n\\n\"You gave them everything I had!\" the boy said. \"Everything I\\'ve saved in my \\nentire life!\" \\n\\n\"Well, what good would it be to you if you had t6 die?\" the alchemist \\nanswered. \"Your money saved us for three days. It\\'s not often that money \\nsaves a person\\'s life.\" \\n\\nBut the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom. He had no \\nidea how he was going to transform himself into the wind. He wasn\\'t an \\nalchemist! \\n\\nThe alchemist asked one of the soldiers for some tea, and poured some on \\nthe boy\\'s wrists. A wave of relief washed over him, and the alchemist \\nmuttered some words that the boy didn\\'t understand. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t give in to your fears,\" said the alchemist, in a strangely gentle voice. \\n\"If you do, you won\\'t be able to talk to your heart.\" \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 80 / 94\\n\\n\"But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind.\" \\n\\n\"If a person is living out his destiny, he knows everything he needs to know. \\nThere is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear \\nof failure.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m not afraid of failing. It\\'s just that I don\\'t know how to turn myself into \\nthe wind.\" \\n\\n\"Well, you\\'ll have to learn; your life depends on it.\" \\n\\n\"But what if I can\\'t?\" \\n\\n\"Then you\\'ll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny. That\\'s a lot \\nbetter than dying like millions of other people, who never even knew what \\ntheir destinies were. \\n\\n\"But don\\'t worry,\" the alchemist continued. \"Usually the threat of death \\nmakes people a lot more aware of their lives.\" \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe first day passed. There was a major battle nearby, and a number of \\nwounded were brought back to the camp. The dead soldiers were replaced \\nby others, and life went on. Death doesn\\'t change anything, the boy \\nthought. \\n\\n\"You could have died later on,\" a soldier said to the body of one of his \\ncompanions. \"You could have died after peace had been declared. But, in \\nany case, you were going to die.\" \\n\\nAt the end of the day, the boy went looking for the alchemist, who had \\ntaken his falcon out into the desert. \\n\\n\"I still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind,\" the boy repeated. \\n\\n\"Remember what I told you: the world is only the visible aspect of God. And \\nthat what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the \\nmaterial plane.\" \\n\\n\"What are you doing?\" \\n\\n\"Feeding my falcon.\" \\n\\n\"If I\\'m not able to turn myself into the wind, we\\'re going to die,\" the boy \\nsaid. \"Why feed your falcon?\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re the one who may die,\" the alchemist said. \"I already know how to \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 81 / 94\\n\\nturn myself into the wind.\" \\n\\n* \\n\\nOn the second day, the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp. The \\nsentinels allowed him to go; they had already heard about the sorcerer who \\ncould turn himself into the wind, and they didn\\'t want to go near him. In any \\ncase, the desert was impassable. \\n\\nHe spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over the desert, \\nand listening to his heart. The boy knew the desert sensed his fear. They \\nboth spoke the same language. \\n\\n* \\n\\nOn the third day, the chief met with his officers. He called the alchemist to \\nthe meeting and said, \"Let\\'s go see the boy who turns himself into the \\nwind.\" \\n\\n\"Let\\'s,\" the alchemist answered. \\n\\nThe boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day. He \\ntold them all to be seated. \\n\\n\"It\\'s going to take a while,\" the boy said. \\n\\n\"We\\'re in no hurry,\" the chief answered. \"We are men of the desert.\" \\n\\nThe boy looked out at the horizon. There were mountains in the distance. \\nAnd there were dunes, rocks, and plants that insisted on living where \\nsurvival seemed impossible. There was the desert that he had wandered for \\nso many months; despite all that time, he knew only a small part of it. Within \\nthat small part, he had found an Englishman, caravans, tribal wars, and an \\noasis with fifty thousand palm trees and three hundred wells. \\n\\n\"What do you want here today?\" the desert asked him. \"Didn\\'t you spend \\nenough time looking at me yesterday?\" \\n\\n\"Somewhere you are holding the person I love,\" the boy said. \"So, when I \\nlook out over your sands, I am also looking at her. I want to return to her, \\nand I need your help so that I can turn myself into the wind.\" \\n\\n\"What is love?\" the desert asked. \\n\\n\"Love is the falcon\\'s flight over your sands. Because for him, you are a \\ngreen field, from which he always returns with game. He knows your rocks, \\nyour dunes, and your mountains, and you are generous to him.\" \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 82 / 94\\n\\n\"The falcon\\'s beak carries bits of me, myself,\" the desert said. \"For years, I \\ncare for his game, feeding it with the little water that I have, and then I show \\nhim where the game is. And, one day, as I enjoy the fact that his game \\nthrives on my surface, the falcon dives out of the sky, and takes away what \\nI\\'ve created.\" \\n\\n\"But that\\'s why you created the game in the first place,\" the boy answered. \\n\"To nourish the falcon. And the falcon then nourishes man. And, eventually, \\nman will nourish your sands, where the game will once again flourish. That\\'s \\nhow the world goes.\" \\n\\n\"So is that what love is?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s what love is. It\\'s what makes the game become the falcon, the \\nfalcon become man, and man, in his turn, the desert. It\\'s what turns lead \\ninto gold, and makes the gold return to the earth.\" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand what you\\'re talking about,\" the desert said. \\n\\n\"But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a \\nwoman waiting for me. And that\\'s why I have to turn myself into the wind.\" \\n\\nThe desert didn\\'t answer him for a few moments. \\n\\nThen it told him, \"I\\'ll give you my sands to help the wind to blow, but, alone, \\nI can\\'t do anything. You have to ask for help from the wind.\" \\n\\nA breeze began to blow. The tribesmen watched the boy from a distance, \\ntalking among themselves in a language that the boy couldn\\'t understand. \\n\\nThe alchemist smiled. \\n\\nThe wind approached the boy and touched his face. It knew of the boy\\'s \\ntalk with the desert, because the winds know everything. They blow across \\nthe world without a birthplace, and with no place to die. \\n\\n\"Help me,\" the boy said. \"One day you carried the voice of my loved one to \\nme.\" \\n\\n\"Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind?\" \\n\\n\"My heart,\" the boy answered. \\n\\nThe wind has many names. In that part of the world, it was called the \\nsirocco, because it brought moisture from the oceans to the east. In the \\ndistant land the boy came from, they called it the levanter, because they \\nbelieved that it brought with it the sands of the desert, and the screams of \\nthe Moorish wars. Perhaps, in the places beyond the pastures where his \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 83 / 94\\n\\nsheep lived, men thought that the wind came from Andalusia. But, actually, \\nthe wind came from no place at all, nor did it go to any place; that\\'s why it \\nwas stronger than the desert. Someone might one day plant trees in the \\ndesert, and even raise sheep there, but never would they harness the wind. \\n\\n\"You can\\'t be the wind,\" the wind said. \"We\\'re two very different things.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s not true,\" the boy said. \"I learned the alchemist\\'s secrets in my \\ntravels. I have inside me the winds, the deserts, the oceans, the stars, and \\neverything created in the universe. We were all made by the same hand, and \\nwe have the same soul. I want to be like you, able to reach every corner of \\nthe world, cross the seas, blow away the sands that cover my treasure, and \\ncarry the voice of the woman I love.\" \\n\\n\"I heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist,\" the \\nwind said. \"He said that everything has its own destiny. But people can\\'t \\nturn themselves into the wind.\" \\n\\n\"Just teach me to be the wind for a few moments,\" the boy said. \"So you \\nand I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds.\" \\n\\nThe wind\\'s curiosity was aroused, something that had never happened \\nbefore. It wanted to talk about those things, but it didn\\'t know how to turn a \\nman into the wind. And look how many things the wind already knew how to \\ndo! It created deserts, sank ships, felled entire forests, and blew through \\ncities filled with music and strange noises. It felt that it had no limits, yet \\nhere was a boy saying that there were other things the wind should be able \\nto do. \\n\\n\"This is what we call love,\" the boy said, seeing that the wind was close to \\ngranting what he requested. \"When you are loved, you can do anything in \\ncreation. When you are loved, there\\'s no need at all to understand what\\'s \\nhappening, because everything happens within you, and even men can turn \\nthemselves into the wind. As long as the wind helps, of course.\" \\n\\nThe wind was a proud being, and it was becoming irritated with what the \\nboy was saying. It commenced to blow harder, raising the desert sands. But \\nfinally it had to recognize that, even making its way around the world, it \\ndidn\\'t know how to turn a man into the wind. And it knew nothing about \\nlove. \\n\\n\"In my travels around the world, I\\'ve often seen people speaking of love and \\nlooking toward the heavens,\" the wind said, furious at having to \\nacknowledge its own limitations. \"Maybe it\\'s better to ask heaven.\" \\n\\n\"Well then, help me do that,\" the boy said. \"Fill this place with a sandstorm \\nso strong that it blots out the sun. Then I can look to heaven without \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 84 / 94\\n\\nblinding myself.\" \\n\\nSo the wind blew with all its strength, and the sky was filled with sand. The \\nsun was turned into a golden disk. \\n\\nAt the camp, it was difficult to see anything. The men of the desert were \\nalready familiar with that wind. They called it the simum, and it was worse \\nthan a storm at sea. Their horses cried out, and all their weapons were filled \\nwith sand. \\n\\nOn the heights, one of the commanders turned to the chief and said, \\n\"Maybe we had better end this!\" \\n\\nThey could barely see the boy. Their faces were covered with the blue \\ncloths, and their eyes showed fear. \\n\\n\"Let\\'s stop this,\" another commander said. \\n\\n\"I want to see the greatness of Allah,\" the chief said, with respect. \"I want to \\nsee how a man turns himself into the wind.\" \\n\\nBut he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had \\nexpressed their fear. As soon as the wind stopped, he was going to remove \\nthem from their commands, because true men of the desert are not afraid. \\n\\n\"The wind told me that you know about love \" the boy said to the sun. \"If \\nyou know about love, you must also know about the Soul of the World, \\nbecause it\\'s made of love.\" \\n\\n\"From where I am,\" the sun said, \"I can see the Soul of the World. It \\ncommunicates with my soul, and together we cause the plants to grow and \\nthe sheep to seek out shade. From where I amâ€”and I\\'m a long way from \\nthe earthâ€”I learned how to love. I know that if I came even a little bit closer \\nto the earth, everything there would die, and the Soul of the World would no \\nlonger exist. So we contemplate each other, and we want each other, and I \\ngive it life and warmth, and it gives me my reason for living.\" \\n\\n\"So you know about love,\" the boy said. \\n\\n\"And I know the Soul of the World, because we have talked at great length \\nto each other during this endless trip through the universe. It tells me that its \\ngreatest problem is that, up until now, only the minerals and vegetables \\nunderstand that all things are one. That there\\'s no need for iron to be the \\nsame as copper, or copper the same as gold. Each performs its own exact \\nfunction as a unique being, and everything would be a symphony of peace \\nif the hand that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation. \\n\\n\"But there was a sixth day,\" the sun went on. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 85 / 94\\n\\n\"You are wise, because you observe everything from a distance,\" the boy \\nsaid. \"But you don\\'t know about love. If there hadn\\'t been a sixth day, man \\nwould not exist; copper would always be just copper, and lead just lead. It\\'s \\ntrue that everything has its destiny, but one day that destiny will be realized. \\nSo each thing has to transform itself into something better, and to acquire a \\nnew destiny, until, someday, the Soul of the World becomes one thing \\nonly.\" \\n\\nThe sun thought about that, and decided to shine more brightly. The wind, \\nwhich was enjoying the conversation, started to blow with greater force, so \\nthat the sun would not blind the boy. \\n\\n\"This is why alchemy exists,\" the boy said. \"So that everyone will search for \\nhis treasure, find it, and then want to be better than he was in his former \\nlife. Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead; and \\nthen lead will have to turn itself into gold. \\n\\n\"That\\'s what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to become \\nbetter than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.\" \\n\\n\"Well, why did you say that I don\\'t know about love?\" the sun asked the boy.\\n\\n\"Because it\\'s not love to be static like the desert, nor is it love to roam the \\nworld like the wind. And it\\'s not love to see everything from a distance, like \\nyou do. Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the \\nWorld. When I first reached through to it, I thought the Soul of the World \\nwas perfect. But later, I could see that it was like other aspects of creation, \\nand had its own passions and wars. It is we who nourish the Soul of the \\nWorld, and the world we live in will be either better or worse, depending on \\nwhether we become better or worse. And that\\'s where the power of love \\ncomes in. Because when we love, we always strive to become better than \\nwe are.\" \\n\\n\"So what do you want of me?\" the sun asked. \\n\\n\"I want you to help me turn myself into the wind,\" the boy answered. \\n\\n\"Nature knows me as the wisest being in creation,\" the sun said. \"But I don\\'t \\nknow how to turn you into the wind.\" \\n\\n\"Then, whom should I ask?\" \\n\\nThe sun thought for a minute. The wind was listening closely, and wanted to \\ntell every corner of the world that the sun\\'s wisdom had its limitations. That \\nit was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World. \\n\\n\"Speak to the hand that wrote all,\" said the sun. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 86 / 94\\n\\nThe wind screamed with delight, and blew harder than ever. The tents were \\nbeing blown from their ties to the earth, and the animals were being freed \\nfrom their tethers. On the cliff, the men clutched at each other as they \\nsought to keep from being blown away. \\n\\nThe boy turned to the hand that wrote all. As he did so, he sensed that the \\nuniverse had fallen silent, and he decided not to speak. \\n\\nA current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to pray. It was a \\nprayer that he had never said before, because it was a prayer without words \\nor pleas. His prayer didn\\'t give thanks for his sheep having found new \\npastures; it didn\\'t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal; and it didn\\'t \\nbeseech that the woman he had met continue to await his return. In the \\nsilence, the boy understood that the desert, the wind, and the sun were also \\ntrying to understand the signs written by the hand, and were seeking to \\nfollow their paths, and to understand what had been written on a single \\nemerald. He saw that omens were scattered throughout the earth and in \\nspace, and that there was no reason or significance attached to their \\nappearance; he could see that not the deserts, nor the winds, nor the sun, \\nnor people knew why they had been created. But that the hand had a \\nreason for all of this, and that only the hand could perform miracles, or \\ntransform the sea into a desertâ€¦ or a man into the wind. Because only the \\nhand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to \\nthe point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work. \\n\\nThe boy reached through to the Soul of the World, and saw that it was a \\npart of the Soul of God. And he saw that the Soul of God was his own soul. \\nAnd that he, a boy, could perform miracles. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe simum blew that day as it had never blown before. For generations \\nthereafter, the Arabs recounted the legend of a boy who had turned himself \\ninto the wind, almost destroying a military camp, in defiance of the most \\npowerful chief in the desert. \\n\\nWhen the simum ceased to blow, everyone looked to the place where the \\nboy had been. But he was no longer there; he was standing next to a sand-\\ncovered sentinel, on the far side of the camp. \\n\\nThe men were terrified at his sorcery. But there were two people who were \\nsmiling: the alchemist, because he had found his perfect disciple, and the \\nchief, because that disciple had understood the glory of God. \\n\\nThe following day, the general bade the boy and the alchemist farewell, and \\nprovided them with an escort party to accompany them as far as they \\nchose. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 87 / 94\\n\\n* \\n\\nThey rode for the entire day. Toward the end of the afternoon, they came \\nupon a Coptic monastery. The alchemist dismounted, and told the escorts \\nthey could return to the camp. \\n\\n\"From here on, you will be alone,\" the alchemist said. \"You are only three \\nhours from the Pyramids.\" \\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said the boy. \"You taught me the Language of the World.\" \\n\\n\"I only invoked what you already knew.\" \\n\\nThe alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery. A monk dressed in \\nblack came to the gates. They spoke for a few minutes in the Coptic \\ntongue, and the alchemist bade the boy enter. \\n\\n\"I asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while,\" the alchemist smiled. \\n\\nThey went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery. The alchemist lighted\\nthe fire, and the monk brought him some lead, which the alchemist placed \\nin an iron pan. When the lead had become liquid, the alchemist took from \\nhis pouch the strange yellow egg. He scraped from it a sliver as thin as a \\nhair, wrapped it in wax, and added it to the pan in which the lead had \\nmelted. \\n\\nThe mixture took on a reddish color, almost the color of blood. The \\nalchemist removed the pan from the fire, and set it aside to cool. As he did \\nso, he talked with the monk about the tribal wars. \\n\\n\"I think they\\'re going to last for a long time,\" he said to the monk. \\n\\nThe monk was irritated. The caravans had been stopped at Giza for some \\ntime, waiting for the wars to end. \"But God\\'s will be done,\" the monk said. \\n\\n\"Exactly,\" answered the alchemist. \\n\\nWhen the pan had cooled, the monk and the boy looked at it, dazzled. The \\nlead had dried into the shape of the pan, but it was no longer lead. It was \\ngold. \\n\\n\"Will I learn to do that someday?\" the boy asked. \\n\\n\"This was my destiny, not yours,\" the alchemist answered. \"But I wanted to \\nshow you that it was possible.\" \\n\\nThey returned to the gates of the monastery. There, the alchemist separated \\nthe disk into four parts. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 88 / 94\\n\\n\"This is for you,\" he said, holding one of the parts out to the monk. \"It\\'s for \\nyour generosity to the pilgrims.\" \\n\\n\"But this payment goes well beyond my generosity,\" the monk responded. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t say that again. Life might be listening, and give you less the next \\ntime.\" \\n\\nThe alchemist turned to the boy. \"This is for you. To make up for what you \\ngave to the general.\" \\n\\nThe boy was about to say that it was much more than he had given the \\ngeneral. But he kept quiet, because he had heard what the alchemist said to \\nthe monk. \\n\\n\"And this is for me,\" said the alchemist, keeping one of the parts. \"Because \\nI have to return to the desert, where there are tribal wars.\" \\n\\nHe took the fourth part and handed it to the monk. \\n\\n\"This is for the boy. If he ever needs it.\" \\n\\n\"But I\\'m going in search of my treasure,\" the boy said. \"I\\'m very close to it \\nnow.\" \\n\\n\"And I\\'m certain you\\'ll find it,\" the alchemist said. \\n\\n\"Then why this?\" \\n\\n\"Because you have already lost your savings twice. Once to the thief, and \\nonce to the general. I\\'m an old, superstitious Arab, and I believe in our \\nproverbs. There\\'s one that says, \\'Everything that happens once can never \\nhappen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third \\ntime.\\' \" They mounted their horses. \\n\\n* \\n\\n\"I want to tell you a story about dreams,\" said the alchemist. \\n\\nThe boy brought his horse closer. \\n\\n\"In ancient Rome, at the time of Emperor Tiberius, there lived a good man \\nwho had two sons. One was in the military, and had been sent to the most \\ndistant regions of the empire. The other son was a poet, and delighted all of \\nRome with his beautiful verses. \\n\\n\"One night, the father had a dream. An angel appeared to him, and told him \\nthat the words of one of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 89 / 94\\n\\nthe world for all generations to come. The father woke from his dream \\ngrateful and crying, because life was generous, and had revealed to him \\nsomething any father would be proud to know. \\n\\n\"Shortly thereafter, the father died as he tried to save a child who was about \\nto be crushed by the wheels of a chariot. Since he had lived his entire life in \\na manner that was correct and fair, he went directly to heaven, where he \\nmet the angel that had appeared in his dream. \\n\\n\" \\'You were always a good man,\\' the angel said to him. \\'You lived your life \\nin a loving way, and died with dignity. I can now grant you any wish you \\ndesire.\\' \\n\\n\" \\'Life was good to me,\\' the man said. \\'When you appeared in my dream, I \\nfelt that all my efforts had been rewarded, because my son\\'s poems will be \\nread by men for generations to come. I don\\'t want anything for myself. But \\nany father would be proud of the fame achieved by one whom he had cared \\nfor as a child, and educated as he grew up. Sometime in the distant future, \\nI would like to see my son\\'s words.\\' \\n\\n\"The angel touched the man\\'s shoulder, and they were both projected far \\ninto the future. They were in an immense setting, surrounded by thousands \\nof people speaking a strange language. \\n\\n\"The man wept with happiness. \\n\\n\" \\'I knew that my son\\'s poems were immortal,\\' he said to the angel through \\nhis tears. \\'Can you please tell me which of my son\\'s poems these people \\nare repeating?\\' \\n\\n\"The angel came closer to the man, and, with tenderness, led him to a \\nbench nearby, where they sat down. \\n\\n\"\\'The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in Rome,\\' the \\nangel said. \\'Everyone loved them and enjoyed them. But when the reign of \\nTiberius ended, his poems were forgotten. The words you\\'re hearing now \\nare those of your son in the military.\\' \\n\\n\"The man looked at the angel in surprise. \\n\\n\" \\'Your son went to serve at a distant place, and became a centurion. He \\nwas just and good. One afternoon, one of his servants fell ill, and it \\nappeared that he would die. Your son had heard of a rabbi who was able to \\ncure illnesses, and he rode out for days and days in search of this man. \\nAlong the way, he learned that the man he was seeking was the Son of \\nGod. He met others who had been cured by him, and they instructed your \\nson in the man\\'s teachings. And so, despite the fact that he was a Roman \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 90 / 94\\n\\ncenturion, he converted to their faith. Shortly thereafter, he reached the \\nplace where the man he was looking for was visiting.\\' \\n\\n\" \\'He told the man that one of his servants was gravely ill, and the rabbi \\nmade ready to go to his house with him. But the centurion was a man of \\nfaith, and, looking into the eyes of the rabbi, he knew that he was surely in \\nthe presence of the Son of God.\\' \\n\\n\" \\'And this is what your son said,\\' the angel told the man. \\'These are the \\nwords he said to the rabbi at that point, and they have never been \\nforgotten: \"My Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. \\nBut only speak a word and my servant will be healed.\" \"\\' \\n\\nThe alchemist said, \"No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a \\ncentral role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn\\'t know it.\" \\n\\nThe boy smiled. He had never imagined that questions about life would be \\nof such importance to a shepherd. \\n\\n\"Good-bye,\" the alchemist said. \\n\\n\"Good-bye,\" said the boy. \\n\\n* \\n\\nThe boy rode along through the desert for several hours, listening avidly to \\nwhat his heart had to say. It was his heart that would tell him where his \\ntreasure was hidden. \\n\\n\"Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart,\" the alchemist had told \\nhim. \\n\\nBut his heart was speaking of other things. With pride, it told the story of a \\nshepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had on two different \\noccasions. It told of destiny, and of the many men who had wandered in \\nsearch of distant lands or beautiful women, confronting the people of their \\ntimes with their preconceived notions. It spoke of journeys, discoveries, \\nbooks, and change. \\n\\nAs he was about to climb yet another dune, his heart whispered, \"Be aware \\nof the place where you are brought to tears. That\\'s where I am, and that\\'s \\nwhere your treasure is.\" \\n\\nThe boy climbed the dune slowly. A full moon rose again in the starry sky: it \\nhad been a month since he had set forth from the oasis. The moonlight cast \\nshadows through the dunes, creating the appearance of a rolling sea; it \\nreminded the boy of the day when that horse had reared in the desert, and \\nhe had come to know the alchemist. And the moon fell on the desert\\'s \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 91 / 94\\n\\nsilence, and on a man\\'s journey in search of treasure. \\n\\nWhen he reached the top of the dune, his heart leapt. There, illuminated by \\nthe light of the moon and the brightness of the desert, stood the solemn \\nand majestic Pyramids of Egypt. \\n\\nThe boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making him believe \\nin his destiny, and for leading him to meet a king, a merchant, an \\nEnglishman, and an alchemist. And above all for his having met a woman of \\nthe desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his \\ndestiny. \\n\\nIf he wanted to, he could now return to the oasis, go back to Fatima, and \\nlive his life as a simple shepherd. After all, the alchemist continued to live in \\nthe desert, even though he understood the Language of the World, and \\nknew how to transform lead into gold. He didn\\'t need to demonstrate his \\nscience and art to anyone. The boy told himself that, on the way toward \\nrealizing his own destiny, he had learned all he needed to know, and had \\nexperienced everything he might have dreamed of. \\n\\nBut here he was, at the point of finding his treasure, and he reminded \\nhimself that no project is completed until its objective has been achieved. \\nThe boy looked at the sands around him, and saw that, where his tears had \\nfallen, a scarab beetle was scuttling through the sand. During his time in the \\ndesert, he had learned that, in Egypt, the scarab beetles are a symbol of \\nGod. \\n\\nAnother omen! The boy began to dig into the dune. As he did so, he \\nthought of what the crystal merchant had once said: that anyone could build \\na pyramid in his backyard. The boy could see now that he couldn\\'t do so if \\nhe placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life. \\n\\nThroughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen, but found \\nnothing. He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids \\nhad been built. But he didn\\'t stop. He struggled to continue digging as he \\nfought the wind, which often blew the sand back into the excavation. His \\nhands were abraded and exhausted, but he listened to his heart. It had told \\nhim to dig where his tears fell. \\n\\nAs he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered, he heard \\nfootsteps. Several figures approached him. Their backs were to the \\nmoonlight, and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their faces. \\n\\n\"What are you doing here?\" one of the figures demanded. \\n\\nBecause he was terrified, the boy didn\\'t answer. He had found where his \\ntreasure was, and was frightened at what might happen. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 92 / 94\\n\\n\"We\\'re refugees from the tribal wars, and we need money,\" the other figure \\nsaid. \"What are you hiding there?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m not hiding anything,\" the boy answered. \\n\\nBut one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole. \\nAnother, who was searching the boy\\'s bags, found the piece of gold. \\n\\n\"There\\'s gold here,\" he said. \\n\\nThe moon shone on the face of the Arab who had seized him, and in the \\nman\\'s eyes the boy saw death. \\n\\n\"He\\'s probably got more gold hidden in the ground.\" \\n\\nThey made the boy continue digging, but he found nothing. As the sun \\nrose, the men began to beat the boy. He was bruised and bleeding, his \\nclothing was torn to shreds, and he felt that death was near. \\n\\n\"What good is money to you if you\\'re going to die? It\\'s not often that money \\ncan save someone\\'s life,\" the alchemist had said. Finally, the boy screamed \\nat the men, \"I\\'m digging for treasure!\" And, although his mouth was \\nbleeding and swollen, he told his attackers that he had twice dreamed of a \\ntreasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt. \\n\\nThe man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the \\nothers: \"Leave him. He doesn\\'t have anything else. He must have stolen this \\ngold.\" \\n\\nThe boy fell to the sand, nearly unconscious. The leader shook him and \\nsaid, \"We\\'re leaving.\" \\n\\nBut before they left, he came back to the boy and said, \"You\\'re not going to \\ndie. You\\'ll live, and you\\'ll learn that a man shouldn\\'t be so stupid. Two years \\nago, right here on this spot, I had a recurrent dream, too. I dreamed that I \\nshould travel to the fields of Spain and look for a ruined church where \\nshepherds and their sheep slept. In my dream, there was a sycamore \\ngrowing out of the ruins of the sacristy, and I was told that, if I dug at the \\nroots of the sycamore, I would find a hidden treasure. But I\\'m not so stupid \\nas to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream.\" \\n\\nAnd they disappeared. \\n\\nThe boy stood up shakily, and looked once more at the Pyramids. They \\nseemed to laugh at him, and he laughed back, his heart bursting with joy. \\n\\nBecause now he knew where his treasure was. \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 93 / 94\\n\\nEPILOGUE \\n\\nThe boy reached the small, abandoned church just as night was falling. The \\nsycamore was still there in the sacristy, and the stars could still be seen \\nthrough the half-destroyed roof. He remembered the time he had been \\nthere with his sheep; it had been a peaceful nightâ€¦ except for the dream. \\n\\nNow he was here not with his flock, but with a shovel. \\n\\nHe sat looking at the sky for a long time. Then he took from his knapsack a \\nbottle of wine, and drank some. He remembered the night in the desert \\nwhen he had sat with the alchemist, as they looked at the stars and drank \\nwine together. He thought of the many roads he had traveled, and of the \\nstrange way God had chosen to show him his treasure. If he hadn\\'t believed \\nin the significance of recurrent dreams, he would not have met the Gypsy \\nwoman, the king, the thief, orâ€¦ \"Well, it\\'s a long list. But the path was \\nwritten in the omens, and there was no way I could go wrong,\" he said to \\nhimself. \\n\\nHe fell asleep, and when he awoke the sun was already high. He began to \\ndig at the base of the sycamore. \\n\\n\"You old sorcerer,\" the boy shouted up to the sky. \"You knew the whole \\nstory. You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this \\nchurch. The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters. Couldn\\'t \\nyou have saved me from that?\" \\n\\n\"No,\" he heard a voice on the wind say. \"If I had told you, you wouldn\\'t have \\nseen the Pyramids. They\\'re beautiful, aren\\'t they?\" \\n\\nThe boy smiled, and continued digging. Half an hour later, his shovel hit \\nsomething solid. An hour later, he had before him a chest of Spanish gold \\ncoins. There were also precious stones, gold masks adorned with red and \\nwhite feathers, and stone statues embedded with jewels. The spoils of a \\nconquest that the country had long ago forgotten, and that some \\nconquistador had failed to tell his children about. \\n\\nThe boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag. He had used the two \\nstones only once, one morning when he was at a marketplace. His life and \\nhis path had always provided him with enough omens. \\n\\nHe placed Urim and Thummim in the chest. They were also a part of his \\nnew treasure, because they were a reminder of the old king, whom he would \\n\\n\\x0cPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist\\n\\nPage 94 / 94\\n\\nnever see again. \\n\\nIt\\'s true; life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny, the boy \\nthought. Then he remembered that he had to get to Tarifa so he could give \\none-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy woman, as he had promised. Those \\nGypsies are really smart, he thought. Maybe it was because they moved \\naround so much. \\n\\nThe wind began to blow again. It was the levanter, the wind that came from \\nAfrica. It didn\\'t bring with it the smell of the desert, nor the threat of Moorish \\ninvasion. Instead, it brought the scent of a perfume he knew well, and the \\ntouch of a kissâ€”a kiss that came from far away, slowly, slowly, until it \\nrested on his lips. \\n\\nThe boy smiled. It was the first time she had done that. \\n\\n\"I\\'m coming, Fatima,\" he said. \\n\\n\\x0c'"
